How to Influence Decisions in “The Room Where It Happens”

## The Room Where It Happens

We’re borrowing a phrase from the musical *Hamilton*: there are many moments in life where important decisions about you are made **without you being present** in the final discussion. This applies to founders and employees alike, in contexts such as:

- **Promotions**  
- **Raises**  
- **Demotions** (though these are increasingly rare; more commonly, people are simply fired)  
- **Fundraising** (the final partner meeting where investors decide whether or not to invest)  
- **Product decisions**  
- **Annual planning** (in large companies, the budget or headcount discussions often happen without you)  
- **RIFs (Reductions in Force)**

We want to talk about **how you can influence these decisions**, assuming you’ve already presented a strong factual argument. Facts and logic are “table stakes.” Beyond that, there are other factors that affect how people in “the room where it happens” make their final call.

## Key Factors That Influence Decisions

### 1. Your Attitude, Demeanor, and Track Record

- **Attitude**: People making the decision consider whether they’ll be spending more or less time with you if things go your way. They ask, “Do I *want* to spend more time with this person?” Being too negative or consistently pessimistic makes people wary of deeper collaboration.  
- **Demeanor**: If you’re always critical or bring an overly negative vibe, decision makers may feel reluctant to work more closely with you. This doesn’t mean you must be overly polite or lack confidence. It simply means you should be aware of how your demeanor affects the team and the organization.  
- **Track Record**: A strong history of successful execution (“this person gets things done”) helps tremendously. People often consider: “If this person disappeared tomorrow, how badly would that hurt our organization?” Strive to become someone the team can’t afford to lose—someone who’s *irreplaceable*.

### 2. Personal Brand and Cultural Fit

- **Personal Brand**: It’s shaped by how others remember working with you. If you’ve built a reputation for high-quality work, collaboration, and good judgment, that brand follows you into every decision-making forum.  
- **Cultural Norms**: In some organizations, internal politics and lobbying are unavoidable. In others (like many startups), those tactics can backfire. Understanding the culture and its values is critical. Overdoing “office politics” or performing contrived gestures can be worse than doing nothing at all.

### 3. The “Heart” Factor

- **Giving vs. Taking**: Decision makers also notice whether someone gives more than they take. A “mercenary” mindset—focusing solely on personal gain—can be off-putting. If you genuinely care about the product, your teammates, and customers, it’s easier for decision makers to say, “Yes, I want to work more closely with this person.”

### 4. Avoiding Desperation

- **Fundraising Example**: Founders who get overly attached to a single investor (“If I don’t get *this* partner to fund me, I’m doomed!”) often come across as desperate. Investors (and anyone who’s made many decisions) can sense desperation quickly, and it’s rarely attractive.  
- **Counterbalance**: When founders have more runway (e.g., due to YC’s updated standard deal size), they can adopt a calmer, “take it or leave it” attitude. Ironically, that *confidence* often makes them more appealing to investors.

### 5. The Game Repeats

- **Long-Term Mindset**: Even if you lose a particular decision—be it a raise, promotion, or funding round—how you handle that disappointment matters. People remember professionalism and grace under pressure, which influences future decisions.  
- **Responding to Setbacks**: If you handle losses poorly, it can cast a shadow on your reputation. If you handle them gracefully, you strengthen trust and preserve goodwill for the next time you’re vying to influence an outcome.

## Putting It All Together

1. **Start with a Solid Factual Argument**: Logic and data form the baseline (“table stakes”).  
2. **Manage Attitude and Demeanor**: Show you can work well with others and that people will enjoy collaborating with you.  
3. **Build a Strong Personal Brand**: Cultivate a reputation for high-quality work and teamwork.  
4. **Demonstrate You’re Irreplaceable**: If losing you would be painful, decision makers often lean in your favor.  
5. **Stay Genuine**: Don’t default to politics or manipulation. Sincerity and genuine enthusiasm for the mission are powerful.  
6. **Avoid Desperation**: Confidence (not arrogance) signals competence. Desperation signals uncertainty.  
7. **Think Long-Term**: Each decision is part of a repeating game. Handle outcomes—good or bad—with professionalism.
