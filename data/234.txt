# How to Tell Whether Your Company Is Recovering from “ZIRP”

**Note**: This text is reorganized from a conversational format into a more structured document. It is based on a discussion between two speakers (Dalton and Michael) about the concept of “ZIRP” (Zero-Percent-Interest-Rate Syndrome) and how to recognize when a company is recovering from the effects of the Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon (ZIRP). No information has been removed, but the text is now presented in a clearer, more organized way. The reference to `[Music]` has been removed.

## Introduction

When my company was infected with “ZIRP,” I was working three days a week. I got to enjoy a lot of hobbies, travel, and live a nomadic lifestyle. I felt like I had a great work-life balance. However, this week my boss asked me to do something over the weekend, and it felt like a violation—some people might say, “You should report him to HR.” 

This is a common scenario for many who grew accustomed to the easy-money era triggered by zero interest rates (often referred to as ZIRP). But now that era is ending, and companies are trying to recover from ZIRP. 

An intelligent founder coined the term “ZIRP,” and it fits perfectly: it describes how businesses operated when money was essentially free, investors were generous, and metrics or KPIs seemed to matter less. Now, we are in a phase of correction or recovery. 

This guide explains how to tell whether your company is effectively recovering from ZIRP—and why that might actually be a good thing.

## What Is ZIRP?

- **ZIRP**: Zero-Percent-Interest-Rate Syndrome, an effect stemming from the period of time (particularly during COVID) when interest rates were effectively zero. Money was “thrown around like trees,” many companies (big or small) saw massive fundraises, and normal business constraints did not seem to apply.
- With the shift away from zero interest rates, many organizations now have to “wake up” and transition to more traditional business realities, where actual performance matters.

## Signs Your Company Is Recovering from ZIRP

Below are key indicators that your company is likely in the process of recalibrating and shedding the unhealthy practices that thrived during ZIRP.

---

### 1. Executive Turnover at the Top

One of the most obvious signs is when senior leadership changes. This can look like:

- **High Turnover Among Executives**  
  At first glance, that might seem like a bad thing, but it can be beneficial. During ZIRP, large organizations often hired “big company” executives used to an environment with:
  - Infinite resources
  - Little accountability

  In a huge company like Google, this kind of executive might be a minor “paper cut,” but in a smaller or scaling startup, they can become a “flesh-eating virus.” They’re not used to having to do more with less, and their strategies may become unworkable when the environment changes.

- **Founders Becoming More Involved**  
  Often, the founders realize that the executives they hired aren’t delivering what the company truly needs. The founders might step back in to fix major problems, shifting from “peacetime” to “wartime” leadership.  
  - In many ZIRP companies, founders got boxed out by their own leadership teams (“That’s the Head of Product’s job, not yours!”). But if those people aren’t doing a good job, it’s the founder’s responsibility to step in.

Turnover and greater founder involvement are strong signs that the company is awake to the new economic reality and is actively trying to correct course.

### 2. Return to the Office

During the height of ZIRP and the pandemic, many companies embraced fully remote or hybrid work, often proclaiming offices were a thing of the past. Some founders enjoyed living abroad and others promoted the idea that physical offices were obsolete. 

However, once the environment shifts away from lockdowns and zero interest rates:

- **Executives Who ‘Get Real’ Encourage Return to Office**  
  They recognize that collaboration, culture, and productivity often improve when teams are co-located or spend significant time together in person.
- **Decision-Making**  
  A leadership team willing to enforce a return to the office (or a more structured in-person policy) is likely also serious about making the business succeed. They are willing to make hard decisions—even if some employees won’t like it.

If your company announces a “return to office” plan, it could be a sign of a healthy correction away from the unrealistic working patterns that thrived under ZIRP.

### 3. Reduction of Vanity Projects

**Vanity projects** are initiatives that don’t actually serve customers or drive profit; they exist for reasons like:

- Inflating someone’s résumé or internal status.  
- Wasting company resources on things that don’t matter.  
- Justifying promotions by artificially inflating an executive’s org size.  

During the ZIRP era, these projects were widespread. Now, if your company is shutting down or redirecting resources away from such “fake work,” it’s a positive indicator. It means leadership is scrutinizing how to spend money and aiming for tangible business value.

### 4. Tightening of Excessive HR Benefits

At the peak of ZIRP, some organizations treated employees almost like VIP guests at a never-ending resort:

- **DoorDash stipends, free haircuts, massages, etc.**  
- **Extra “mental health” days and extended vacation policies.**  

While some perks may have been helpful during COVID lockdowns, they’re often unsustainable. Cutting back on extreme benefits suggests management is:

- Focusing on essentials like building real products and serving real customers.
- Treating employees as adults, trusted to make decisions about their own lives without being cocooned.
- Demonstrating seriousness about the business’s long-term goals.

These rollbacks may feel like a loss of lifestyle for some, but they are a clear sign of a company recalibrating from an era of easy money to the reality of running a sustainable business.

### 5. Expectation of More Work (Including Weekends)

This might be a “sticky” or unpopular one. During the pandemic and peak ZIRP, many employees got used to:

- **Working fewer days per week**  
- **Traveling while working**  
- **Minimal oversight regarding hours**

Now, your boss might ask you to do something on the weekend or put in extra hours. This can feel like a violation of work-life balance, but remember:

1. **Companies Not at Google Scale Often Need Hustle**  
   If you’re at an earlier-stage or mid-stage company, there’s a lot of work to do. The company might still be in a precarious position where success depends on team members stepping up.

2. **You’ll Gain More Skills and Responsibility**  
   Being part of a focused, hard-working team means you’re more likely to learn and grow in your role. This can pay off in the long run, whether in career development or equity that’s actually worth something.

## Why This Matters

If you notice your company taking these steps—executive turnover, returning to the office, eliminating vanity projects, tightening unsustainable HR perks, and increasing work expectations—it’s probably a **good** thing in the context of long-term survival and success. 

- **Equity Value**  
  A realistic, hard-working culture usually boosts a company’s chances of scaling successfully, making stock options and equity more valuable.
- **Skill Development**  
  You’ll learn more in an environment with actual accountability and collaborative spirit.  
- **Personal Fulfillment**  
  Feeling like your work has meaning and contributes to real goals is generally more satisfying than lingering in “fake work” that doesn’t matter.

## What If Your Company Is Not Recovering?

If your company shows little sign of course-correcting—still full of vanity projects, aimless spending, no founder involvement, or no real push toward accountability—then you might consider:

1. **Looking for a New Job**  
   Seek a company that’s making the necessary changes and taking its mission seriously.
2. **Starting Your Own Company**  
   If you desire flexibility (maybe you enjoy a more nomadic lifestyle) or you see an opportunity, consider founding your own business or becoming a contractor/freelancer.

Either way, if you want a sustainable future, it’s crucial to spot a company’s direction sooner rather than later.

## Conclusion

The aftermath of zero interest rates (ZIRP) and the resulting ZIRP is still unfolding. Many companies are slowly awakening to financial realities and operational constraints that didn’t matter during the heyday of easy money. 

A company that is **truly** recovering from ZIRP will:

1. Encourage or enforce needed leadership changes.
2. Bring founders back into the driver’s seat.
3. Cut wasteful vanity projects.
4. Adjust extravagant perks to sustainable policies.
5. Expect genuine effort from employees, even if it means occasional weekend work.

While some may mourn the loss of certain comforts and perks, these signals typically point to a healthier, more focused organization. In the long run, such an environment can yield better professional development, higher business success rates, and potentially more valuable equity for those who stick around and contribute meaningfully. 

If your workplace doesn’t adapt, don’t be afraid to seek better opportunities or start something of your own. Success rarely thrives in complacency—and the end of ZIRP calls for a mindset of building real value, not just coasting on easy money.
