We're here to announce our pills—yes, brain pills—to make you smart. Dalton plus Michael pills.com: brain pills, yes, smart-guy brain pills! They will protect you from overbelieving in conspiracy theory. 

Alright, this is Dalton plus Michael, and today we're going to talk about conspiracy theories. I have to be honest, and this might or might not be true: Dalton is the right person to talk to about conspiracy theories. This is going to be an interesting conversation.

### Framing the Discussion

**Michael:** Here's the frame that we want to take. I will be making the point that, at the extreme, conspiracy theories were responsible for a lot of the most important innovations over the last 50 to 75 years. I'm going to use the term "conspiracy theories."

**Dalton:** Yeah, I have a slightly different angle. I think my take is that paranoid thinking is different than conspiracy theories, because there's usually a kernel of truth in paranoia, whereas a “true” conspiracy theory might not have much there. So we have a difference of opinions—maybe we're arguing semantics. I do think the best conspiracy theories need a little something to grab hold of.

### Examples of Conspiracy-Driven Innovation

We were going through some of the biggest innovations:

1. **The Internet and Space**  
   - Fear of the Russians was a big driver. You can research this. The original version of the internet, ARPANET, was funded by DARPA, which is a defense entity. The idea was that if our cities were blown up by nuclear bombs, the network would still work by routing around any destroyed city. That was the original funding motivation behind ARPANET.  
   - Everyone understands why we have rockets: they are great at delivering nuclear weapons. It's interesting to think that there were people who either believed or strongly advocated the idea that the Russians were going to nuke us any day. That level of conspiracy theory or paranoia was used to motivate these industries. If we do the math in hindsight, the real odds of being nuked on any particular day might have been low, but that fear pushed innovation.

2. **Crypto**  
   - This one says, "You can't trust the government, and you can't trust money." When the original Bitcoin white paper came out, Satoshi Nakamoto’s writing was directly a reaction to the bank bailouts in 2008 and the financial crisis. There was already an existing idea that the Federal Reserve would dilute the USD until it became worthless, leading to hyperinflation and other catastrophic outcomes—cryptocurrency was seen as the solution.  
   - The conspiracy theory version is: you could wake up tomorrow, and the money in your bank is worthless. In hindsight, the odds of that happening on any day are probably low, but out of this fear emerged an incredible piece of technology which is useful and may be even more so in the future.

3. **Clean Energy / Electric Vehicles**  
   - Some people believe the Earth will die in 100 years if we don't solve our energy problem, and they are extreme advocates. This fear led to strong advocacy within governments and the creation of industries that do create value. It's another example of how paranoia about an existential threat can spur innovation.

4. **AI (Artificial Intelligence / AGI)**  
   - During the rise of AI in Silicon Valley, a significant argument was that AGI—or a superintelligent “AI God,” way smarter than humans—could be developed and exclusively controlled by a single entity like Google. This could result in a dystopian future unless there was a nonprofit or benevolent organization to guide AI toward good rather than evil.  
   - Some people might say this talk of an AI God is exaggerated, but, truly, there are those who believe we’re on the brink of creating a superintelligence. In many of these cases, there's a sense that it's "semi-imminent" and we must prepare immediately. There's a “prepper” aspect: you need to know this secret and prepare now, or else you won't be ready when the singularity happens.

### Paranoia vs. Conspiracy Theory

**Dalton:** I actually take these scenarios more seriously than Michael. I think there’s a tail risk—it’s not zero. I'm more paranoid than he is, but I believe there's a balance. The world’s a better place with some paranoia, but you don't want to go off the deep end.

For example, if you take the “AI God” scenario to the extreme, it’s not just that it could happen one day, but that it could happen soon—and you have to be ready. That’s the case for all of these examples:  
- Nuclear war could happen tomorrow.  
- The financial system could collapse tomorrow.  
- The Earth could be doomed by climate change.  
- An AGI could arrive and change everything overnight.

This sense of “any day now” pushes people to take actions or prepare in radical ways. Sometimes it helps bootstrap movements. Other times, it can lead to people losing their grip on practical life.

### Bomb Shelters vs. Rockets

A useful analogy is distinguishing between building **bomb shelters** and building **rockets** in the 1950s. People sold bomb shelters and made money off fear. Meanwhile, others worked on rocket technologies that eventually led to space exploration and real long-term value. Both were driven by paranoia about nuclear war, but they had very different outcomes for humanity.

For founders or innovators, how do you ensure you're on the rocket-building side rather than the bomb-shelter side?

1. **Watch for Grifters**  
   Grifters attach themselves to conspiracy theories or paranoia and quickly monetize. If it’s too easy to make a fast buck off an existential fear, that's a sign you might be more in “bomb shelter” territory. Building something genuinely transformative (like rockets) is usually harder and takes more time.

2. **One Conspiracy as a Gateway to All**  
   Sometimes one conspiracy theory can be a gateway to others. If you fall down the rabbit hole (like watching hours of conspiracy videos on YouTube), it can be hard to function in daily life or even discern what's real. We saw this with crypto, and we're seeing it with AI—people can become so convinced that one scenario is imminent that they detach from society.

3. **Moderation and Productive Paranoia**  
   Conspiracy theories or paranoia can be useful in moderation, potentially bootstrapping new technologies or ideas. They energize a subset of people who become early adopters or early builders. The ones who benefit most, historically, have been those who take a small bet and maintain a balanced life, rather than those who reshape their entire existence around a fear.

4. **Conspiracy Theories Drive Clicks**  
   Media outlets often amplify conspiracy thinking because it generates attention. Some truly believe in what they say, while others do it simply for sensational thumbnails and monetization. This can steer the conversation into a darker place. So, be mindful of your media consumption and question motivations.

### Wrapping Up

Ultimately, conspiracy theories and paranoia can serve as sparks that ignite transformative innovation—like the internet, rockets, cryptocurrency, electric vehicles, and AI. However, taken too far, they can lead individuals astray into bomb-shelter thinking, grift, and social isolation. The goal is to find a balance: acknowledge the tail risks, remain curious, hedge accordingly, but avoid l
