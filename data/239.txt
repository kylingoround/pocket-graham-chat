# Why You Need a Co-Founder

**Speaker**: Harjeet ("Harge") Taggar, Group Partner at Y Combinator

Building a successful startup is incredibly hard. You’re taking an idea, making it a reality, and competing against established companies with hundreds of employees and years of momentum. It’s tough to handle alone. Having a co-founder helps you:

1. **Get More Work Done**  
   - Two people can accomplish more working hours than one.  
   - If your co-founder has complementary skills, they can do things you can’t.  
   - A smart co-founder can challenge your ideas, talk you out of bad ones, and help find good ones.

2. **Emotional Support**  
   - Startups are a roller coaster, with highs (“We’ll take over the world!”) and lows (“We’re about to die!”).  
   - A co-founder who’s equally all-in can bring you up when you’re down (and vice versa).  
   - This support is different from what you get hiring employees or from people who join later, because your co-founder is deeply invested alongside you from the start.

3. **Pattern Matching**  
   - Almost every massively successful startup had co-founders.  
   - Facebook is often seen as Mark Zuckerberg’s company, but Dustin Moskovitz was a co-founder.  
   - Apple is associated with Steve Jobs, but he literally couldn’t have built the first Apple computer without Steve Wozniak.

## When to Bring On a Co-Founder

**Should you start right now or wait for the perfect co-founder?**  
- In **90%** of cases, spend your effort finding a great co-founder before starting.  
- In **10%** of cases, if you have:  
  1. A very specific idea you’re passionate about, backed by real domain experience or insight.  
  2. The technical skills to build the first version yourself.  

  Then you might begin alone and bring a co-founder on once you have some progress or traction.  

**Example**: Drew Houston (Dropbox)  
- Applied to Y Combinator as a single founder and was initially rejected.  
- YC told him to find a co-founder, so he looked for one while still making progress on his product.  
- He eventually brought on Arash Ferdowsi as a great co-founder.

## What to Look For in a Potential Co-Founder

1. **Ability to Handle Stress Well**  
   - Startups are stressful. If someone handles stress poorly, it can break the relationship.  
   - The best way to know is having worked with them before under pressure.  
   - Even if you’ve been friends or colleagues, you might not have faced *true* startup-level stress together.

2. **Shared Goals and Alignment**  
   - Make sure you and your co-founder want the same things from the startup.  
   - Example: If you want a fast-growing, venture-funded startup, and they want a slow, steady “lifestyle business,” that mismatch will cause major friction.  
   - Talk about motivations and what success looks like before you commit.

3. **Broad, Adaptable Skills**  
   - At least one co-founder should be technical if it’s a software/tech startup.  
   - Beyond that, avoid over-focusing on specific languages or toolsets.  
   - Look for someone smart, curious, and willing to learn—someone on a growth trajectory who can adapt as the company evolves.

## Where to Find Co-Founders

**Ideally, identify potential co-founders long before you plan to start.**  
- Work on weekend or side projects with people.  
- See how they operate, whether they follow through, how they handle collaboration.

**If you’re ready to start now**:
1. **Look at People You Already Know**  
   - Don’t assume they’re unavailable just because they have a job or other commitments.  
   - Make a direct ask: “I’m starting a company. Would you join me as a co-founder?”
   - If they truly say no, ask who *they’d* pick as a co-founder if they were starting a company—then ask for an introduction.

2. **Expand Your Network**  
   - Attend hackathons, open-source communities, and developer meetups.  
   - You’ll meet people who like building things and might be open to starting a company.

3. **YC Co-Founder Matching Platform**  
   - Y Combinator created this platform to help people find co-founders.  
   - It often works best if the two people have overlapping backgrounds, interests, or networks such that they might plausibly have met anyway.

## Testing the Waters and Getting Started

If you **already know each other well**:  
- Just start. Decide on what you’ll build, create a prototype, apply to YC, and so on.

If you **don’t know each other well**:  
- Treat it like a “dating” period. Spend evenings/weekends on small projects.  
- See how you collaborate under pressure, check alignment on goals, and talk through expectations.

## Equity Splits

When you formally incorporate and issue shares to each founder:  
- **Default Advice**: Split equity equally.  
- Even if one founder had the idea first or did some initial work, that’s a short-term difference compared to 10+ years building the company together.  
- Equal splits keep everyone equally motivated and invested.

## Common Reasons for Co-Founder Breakups

1. **Loss of Respect**  
   - If you have different roles (e.g., Sales vs. Tech), friction arises when one side thinks the other isn’t performing well.  
   - Feeling “I could do your job better than you” is usually lethal to the relationship.

2. **Both Want to Be CEO**  
   - Titles might not matter early on, but the CEO role is symbolic of ultimate decision-making power.  
   - If more than one person insists on it, it indicates deeper mistrust or lack of respect.

3. **Different Work Ethic Expectations**  
   - One person wants “all-in, 24/7” while the other wants more work-life balance.  
   - If not addressed, it leads to resentment and tension that can fracture the team.

## Avoiding a Breakup

- **Don’t Avoid Disagreements**: Have difficult conversations early and often.  
- **Regular Check-Ins**: Schedule monthly or periodic one-on-ones to talk about what’s working, what’s not, and how each of you feels. This “release valve” helps prevent big blowups.  
- **Accept Some Risk**: No co-founding relationship is guaranteed. If it fails, learn from the experience and avoid repeating the same mistakes.

## Final Thoughts

- A co-founder greatly increases your chances of success because they help you work faster, support you emotionally, and bring complementary skills.  
- Ideally, partner with someone you already know and respect, but if that’s not possible, you can look beyond your immediate network and use resources like YC’s co-founder matching.  
- Even strong co-founder relationships require active maintenance, open communication, and shared goals.  
- Best of luck finding the right person—and we hope to see you at Y Combinator someday!
