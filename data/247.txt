they measured 60 times cut once the cut didn't go well and some were like oh  do I measure 60 more like [Music] what all right this is Dalton plus Michael and today we're going to talk about why Founders shouldn't think like VCS shocking I I would have never imagined we had this opinion so maybe we should start what is thinking like a VC how does a VC how are they trained to think so let's break this down and I think to start with when we say VC we don't literally just mean venture capitalist this should include management Consultants yes Banker Investment Banking people that work at hedge funds people that work in private Equity there's a whole host of jobs um and the people in these jobs they train you to do a lot of Market sizing to build a bunch of PowerPoints yes right I mean that's a job um to analyze fundraising Trends to do market analysis to read surveys about the market yes um again experts you guys talk tot networks um you pay a lot of attention to the stock market uh Market multiples other things happening in the m&a market it's it's an entire framework of thinking um of small companies as if they were big companies and using these large company metrics and Analysis to apply to them and to be clear for this video if you're in those Industries this is a great way to think we in no way are suggesting yeah these are great tools if you're job is to be an investment banker you should think like an investment banker yeah right Public Market investor should think like a public market investor right on yes however what we have noticed is that this type of thinking either because these Founders have worked in these industries or been exposed to these thoughts yes bring this framework to getting their first startup idea and trying to get a first customer right yes and this is a problem I think that um we see over and over again where it's almost like to us twisted like you start having conversation with the founder and you'll actually feel like you're talking to an investor to a VC and you're like but what about your passion like what what's your opinion like what do you care about and it's all kind of like contrived almost you could have extracted it from Twitter yeah and and it's confusing it's like I didn't hear any of your opinions I don't think and we've just been talking for 20 minutes now an an example that I notic a lot in a YC interview is they want to present a PowerPoint deck or a slide deck yeah and the way they describe the company is the way you would describe a very large company yes but then when you're like well do you have any customers no and so they have 15 slides or they want to spend a lot of time talking about the market opportunity but there's actually nothing whatsoever in terms of traction competitive analysis great competitive analysis slide so everyone listening is got to ask well aren't we VCS y right like isn't this how a YC partner would think when reading application conducting interviews I think that's an excellent point here's the facts when we are reading applications and doing interviews we are investing very very very early and we've been trained on what matters and what doesn't matter and so let's be real what matters is does your idea make any sense yeah any sense do you know anything about it yes do you have the tech skills to build the thing or anything anything basically and can you get any customers yes it's almost it's so basic it shocks people what we are looking for is very basic stuff well and I think what's interesting is that when we try to be smarter we make mistakes correct when we try to be smart about markets or when we try to be smart about comps we make mistakes because one we haven't studied those markets closely and two because startups change they pivot they find new opportunities technology changes time changes well think about it when we make an investment often it does not become a big company for at least 10 years and so if you're trying to to do market analysis and market trends for an investment that won't become big for a decade later it's kind of flawed analysis versus if you're doing analysis of you know new IPOs coming yeah you're you're much closer to that coming to Market and so I'm just arguing this is completely valid analysis but that is not useful yes when applied to a startup with no customers with no product that's not even sure what the what they should be working on no these Frameworks are not necessarily helpful they're not the most helpful so why do founders do this like what's going on in a Founder's head that gets them to think this is how I should assess an opportunity this is how I should figure out whether I work on this idea or not yep is using these tools what's changed why is this far more common now well something I noticed um when we were Founders is there wasn't access into the mind of investors very much no um a lot of their appeal was how elusive they were like behind closed doors you had to be special get access to them and and so a funny thing that has happened is there's now so much content marketing from investors again not neily bad and again we are acknowledging this is a form of marketing of course of course yeah um but you now hear a lot more about market analysis and Market opportunities in addition there's all of these things for college students in post College of programs yes startup classes startup classes and they tend to be taught by non-founders they tend to be taught by investors and a lot of what you learn is about how to pitch how to do market analysis how to identify ideas via market trends what's a good idea right and so if you go to classes at your University or you know wherever you're encountering this stuff if the folks you should ask yourself if the folks teaching this have not had much actual startup experience where they were the founder who had to do the zero to one yeah you might you know most likely this is coming this is a VC mentality bit of advice right they're probably teaching you how to be an investor which is not you know Fair yeah like you know probably those tools are useful in some in some respect but maybe not for being a Founder I also think though that there's another way I see a lot of Founders attacking this a lot of Founders just think this way from first principles good VCS pick good companies and can predict the future yep if I can Model A good VC in my head I will pick a good idea and increase the likely Ood of winning and it's interesting to me because I think that like this is sometimes what I hate about first principal arguments is that like sure if you say it that way it makes sense do you think that's what good VCS really do yeah I mean I I think look to be really Direct on that what do I think great investors do especially later stage than what Y combinator is yes it's they find companies that have product Market fit that are taking off that have incredible traction and they try to find them and invest in them and that's the job just like in a lot of these other m&a all these other types of finance jobs it's usually you find the thing that's making lots of money that's doing really well and then you glom onto it and attach yourself to it and the skill is often getting the thing taking off to take your money versus someone else's money not picking amongst things that haven't launched yet and having Fe about why one's going to do better than the other exactly so unfortunately um when people are doing that other type of investing investing really early like um I worry that there isn't a lot Founders can learn like from investors in that early stage investing and even once you take off there's less to learn admitting that once you're once you have a hockey stick tons to learn from that but if you're like I don't know what idea to work on exactly exactly that's a few steps ahead of where you exactly and most investors are not even really engaging with companies at that stage so like ah there there are fewer tools there I think there's another thing going on too which is fear-based right like I know that if I choose a bad de I'm going to waste a lot of time yeah shouldn't I do all of this analysis first to make sure I don't Cho to make sure I don't choose a bad idea right yeah we see this a lot where there's companies that find real problems and some of their experts end but they are facing cripp Lan anxiety that it's not Venture scale yes again they might be right but they're so obsessed with this way of thinking that oh what if this tops out at 50 million ARR gee yeah can't I'm just not even gonna start a company I'm gonna stay doing you know I'm gonna stay at my job because the IDE I have will Top out at 50 million in Revenue yeah I I Think It's tricky because I think that we have to admit in the startup game you're going after like a high risk low information and high commitment bet and there aren't moves to change those core things right like yeah you can invest on the margin but it's still going to be high risk High commitment and a long-term bat yep and so I think we would argue it's better to kind of focus on areas of your strength areas that you know well like that's where you can problems that you know a lot about that you personally observed maybe you've solved even on a small scale as opposed to like let me get the VC toolbox out to try to judge which idea is good I think the last thing that I see a lot is that when you think like a VC it is easier to get positive feedback from VCS you know when you talk when you pick an idea because it's the hot thing on Twitter it's easier to get meetings yep when you talk about companies using VC language when you show some Market slide that says this Market is right like investors are responding to that and I think that's confusing to Founders because I mean investors can respond to things that aren't good yes in fact wouldn't we say that's most of what they respond like that's our job is like most investors bet on things that don't work yeah I mean that is the job yeah and and again one way to detect this is that you spend all your time paying attention to fundraising Trends and the way you come up with the startup idea is to read what is raising money and then the thing that is raising the most money yeah and that's the algorithm and then maybe raise some money and then then what yeah like that's that is an algorithm we see a lot from this type of thinking which is all of these companies raise money I'm going to do it too and we're just suggesting we've seen that not go well a lot of the time I think uh this brings up the next topic perfectly so like all right I uh what happens when founders think like BCS and then encounter the real world yep so you did your analysis you've done your validation there's a big Market opportunity it's on Trend VC is going to like it I'm all lined up but now I got to get my first customer uh oh what's the what's the VC investor toolbox for getting customer one this is it's very humbly again if we were to if we were to start a startup we know like the first thing I would admit is that no matter what I know from investing in startups that does not mean getting first customers is going to be easy for me or for Michael or for anyone it is freaking hard yep and this zero to one is always the Trap it's the bear trap that people run into yeah that they're like they're already focused on scaling the company and raising money um and they're like kind of like glossing over or being handwavy on how hard it is to get first customers like yeah we're going to build our first version we're going to launch it and then we're going to be growing and then you know and then they launch it and it doesn't go well and people are just shocked it's funny it's like they measured 60 times cut once the cut didn't go well and some were like oh do I measure 60 more time like what I do this is the this is one of the reasons we usually advise to launch quickly is so you get this hard medicine quickly yeah that your first launch is probably not going to work and no one's going to want your thing yeah right I think we also see when founders have this mentality some will kind of engage in the 0 to1 and kind of fail and like live in that zone I see a lot not even engaging in the 0 to1 like you know they're hiring a bunch of people getting an office like they almost forget they have to get the first customer and they start gearing up for customer 100 well but it's because if your marketing analysis is perfect it's impossible that the customers won't want it right a foregone concl the first customer is a forone what's the real problem is how do we scale yeah I'm much more worried about that yes yeah so I think it's funny you described it I like this analogy like the the Starcraft analogy what's the yeah it's kind of like we've all played real-time strategy games like Starcraft or or what have you and when you're playing one of those games you're just like okay need more pylons okay cool let's let's build some Siege tanks over here you're basically playing a video game it's just a you've got to scale the thing up as quickly as possible there's not like a version of Starcraft where you know you try to build the base and it doesn't work or like your units all just like die or something I don't know like it's that it's a different game and so I think people are playing this like ramp up scale game yeah and they feel like they're playing a video game and again they're completely shocked how hard it is to get it off the ground it is really different than what people expect yeah it's funny when I was playing Starcraft way back in the day like people always talk about macro versus micro and I feel as though investors love macro macro you can you want an Excel spreadsheet yeah what's your build order like what's your Tech Tree da and I remember like you can macro like a and then when you have three guys versus The Other Guys three guys and they're better at micro than you you just lose like you just it's just like you just lose and like I would have friends who are so good at Starcraft like they would just play me crippled and still destroy me and it works the same way here right like and I think that's a great point we're if you engage with this metaphor we're talking about micro you've got to be great at micro to get something off the ground great and yes no amount of macro experience helps you be good at micro I think you start being great at micro to earn the privilege of doing macro at all and then how many CEOs do we find who still serm on the road they're like oh crap I got to get into that product because it's something's broken I got to go six levels down and fix something cuz like well I would compare it to you know I think a lot of people would love to be Ryan from flexport where he was buying a 747 he's buying Jets yeah and like moving stuff all over the world Y and what he's worrying on worrying about now is micro micro right like some things changed in the market and now he's extremely worried about micro and his company and that's what makes him great is he can shift between those two things yes and when he gets down to micro he can get some real stuff so what's the cure Dalton I am a Founder I admit I'm thinking a VC and I don't want to what is the cure I think to start with this is a case of being good at in learning certain things that may not serve you at a at a certain time again let me give you an example let's say that someone worked at a big company for a while and learned a lot about corporate politics okay file that away in the memory bank sure maybe someday that will be helpful yeah but like forget it prot like whatever part of your brain was saving that turn off the those neurons if you're trying to do a very early stage startup I would argue this is a similar thing which is all you know all the Excel spreadsheet modeling you learn as an investment banker that's great just turn that off though like unlearn that doesn't serve you now NOP and and embrace the beginner's mind yeah um to get your startup off the ground yes and then if you're very successful you'll use these skills again they just exactly you earn the right you'll earn the right to use exactly yeah no I also think about this is like turn off the pollution like whatever the sources of knowledge they like you know diagnose why you started thinking this way and if that means like unfollowing some people on Twitter or not reading certain Publications like to do it we're susceptible to the inputs that come to our mind and like the easiest way we do this is turn that media off I also think spending time with your users is a cure for this because your users don't care about macro at all no if you're if you're solving a problem for some industry they probably don't care about the fundraising announcements nope in AI land again let me let me give a concrete example there's lots of people applying to YC with co-pilot for X ideas you know Co we're going to do co-pilot for Trucking yeah and they'll and then the mark they'll be like we did market analysis AI is really big and it's growing really fast oh Trucking really big and trucking is really big and growing fast and so what we're going to do is build AI for Trucking yeah fund us yes and then and then it's like okay well what exactly what is that be specific what exactly are you going to build for AI for Trucking yeah well we'll talk let me get back to you to that we'll talk to the trucking companies and figure out what they yeah it's like the asking the founder of the precise exact thing they're going to build they hadn't thought that far ahead they it's combining Ai and trucking seems like something that will raise money and seems like a idea and seems on Trend and the details feel like irrelevant details and sometimes people get frustrated when we ask these questions they feel like why are you asking these stupid questions what does it what precisely does our AI Trucking startup do exactly yeah shouldn't we go back to competitive analysis and and but basically land grab if you spend time a ton of time with trucking companies yeah you are likely to have a whole different perspective here on how AI could solve problems in trucking but you have to go really deep and spend time with them versus sitting you know in your apartment reading market analysis you know this is something I see with YC Founders I just talked to a former YC founder literally yesterday who he admitted his first two or three companies were kind of this things he thought were good ideas and during that whole time one of the things he did was he owned a a used auto dealer um and his latest idea has to do with giving people auto loans at used car lots and hearing him talk about it I'm like you know this almost as well as if you've owned a used car for the last 15 years like and he could go Point by point on why the people before didn't work what the motivations it turns out like for a lot of these financing companies the carlot makes more money selling getting the referral fee on finance and so like a lot of the a direct consumer oh I come in with my loan preapproved the guy in the car lot is trying to convince you to take a different yeah that's that doesn't help it doesn't help so it's like all this crap that you wouldn't know if you didn't run a freaking car lot and you know he's gotten ideas in the space I don't want to you know I won't say what he's actually going to do but it's just so refreshing to hear someone whereas I think an investor would say with an investor be like oh this is like an this space doesn't work like oh like oh people have tried and and like when you actually get in the weeds it's a cool idea so anyways I think that um if you can resist this thinking like a BC I think what I've realized is you kind of have superpowers I think this virus has invaded a fairly large percentage Founders yes and so you actually get to do things other Founders would think would be silly yeah there it's like everyone has a filter for what seems like a good idea or not and if your filter is exactly the same as everyone else's you're all going to be screening out the same ideas right but if your filter is calibrated differently you will see things that other people have decided as bad right well I think that's what's so funny is because that's the every successful YC story that's the story in hindsight right it's like everyone thought the idea sucked it was off Trend because it was off Trend it was a bad model yeah a bad space the market wasn't big enough whatever and lo and behold 10 years later our predictive powers of the investment Community aren't very good so anyways I think that if you don't fall for this trap you get superpowers but you fall and and I think there's one more really important point I want to make on this which is we're trained to want to have the entire plan worked out yes and remember this is something that sometimes Founders do is they're like they'll put a slide in their slide deck of exit strategy like basically when they're trying to choose what idea to work on yeah they're they want to include but we know he's going to buy us who what that they're going to sell the company and for how much into who and of course delete that site like oh my God like are you kidding me yes and and the point I'm trying to make here is if you think like an investment banker you do need to think about an exit strategy if you're a private Equity company you're buying a mattress company for hundreds of million dollars you definitely want to have an exit strategy slide yes and to me the Evergreen lesson here is that you don't need all of the full plan today and a lot of Founders are worried what if I do this idea I'm really confident people want it but I'm going to top out at $20 million of annual revenue it's a bad idea then right and it's so rare you can attest to this Michael it's so rare in this job where we see a company that gets to 20 million 30 million 40 million in annual revenue and the founder has no idea on how to grow it yeah there's no there's no move they're out of ideas I'm not going to say that never happens but it's extremely rare I think it's a problem you want to have among all the problems if you could choose one and so if you're filtering out ideas that you that seem great and you have expertise in it but you're worried it'll only get to 50 million or whatever yeah don't you don't need the full plan today it's okay to not worry about some of these problems until your later stage you know personally like did on this front I remember I got the course book for University and I remember reading it and thinking okay I know the 36 classes I'm going to take before going to school I was like well I mean the book's here you read it you pick the classes and I remember you know halfway through the first semester being like well that was a bunch of wasted work yeah and I I I I wish sometimes Founders would embrace it's going to be a bit of an adventure yeah it's going to be a bit of an adventure anyways good chat dalon sounds good thanks
