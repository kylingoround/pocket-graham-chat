they will take something you know Anonymous arvar 42 said as like gospel and base their entire life philosophy around it yes yes don't do that don't do that all right welcome to dton plus Michael and today we're going to talk about how fast is too fast for moving a startup um I'll start with the story I was talking to a YC company could have been this batch could have been a previous batch yeah let's anonymize it we don't want to probably every batch to be honest common story and a summary of what they told me was and we got into YC with this idea we called 25 companies mostly startups of course over the last two weeks none of them wanted to buy our product which doesn't exist it's just an idea and so we decided to Pivot and so can you help us and people may not know why we think that's funny okay please this is funny to us because that was very low effort yes trying to contact 25 people me like well I guess I guess we're done I guess no one wants it is so low effort yes as to be funny to us so carry on with the story what was interesting to me about this was that like these two Founders had a vision in their head and the second that the path in the startup didn't line up with this Vision in their head which was that well I think this idea sounds good well I see fun of this idea so therefore everyone IAL to must think this idea is good they got a little freaked out but then the second thing that I love is that like the instinct to talk to Startup Founders it was like I want to vet this with startup people often because I feel like it's easier to sell them even though this isn't a problem that startups have the overarching thing was like this was not even rigorous thinking like like where these people used to work if someone they hired said this to them they would like laugh at them yet they're doing it themselves yeah why do they do this the version of this that I see a lot is people the way they start with their company is to cold email a bunch of people on LinkedIn they're like okay we're doing our startup we're going full-time um well so cool well what are you doing well we we we LinkedIn in in mailed we spammed a thousand people yes and we only got three responses so I guess no one wants this yes and that doesn't work friends like that's not sufficient no um this is very superficial validation yeah that people are doing right like and so I think people do this because no one told them differently um here actually here's another one for you on this topic yeah I think that a lot of people are trained as PMs and they're trained to do user research yes and being trained to do user research I remember taking a user research course in college is you're you're trained to sort of like interview people rather than sell products to them yep and if you can't even interview people you're not really sure what to do and so I think my argument is if you've been trained to be a PM or trained to do user interview research you struggle with getting first customers because the skills that you learned to do this research don't don't apply I also think that if you come from a big company either in product or engineering more often than not you've never solved your own problem like you're working on other people's problems and so I think that your instinct when you start a company is like almost a Consulting Instinct I need to go around I had to talk to a lot of people I figure out what their problem is and I have to solve it which I think is um tricky because it resembles what you did in big Co but it probably doesn't represent what the founder of your bigco did start their big right it's like who should you copy like yourself employee 10,000 or what about employee one what did that person do so you know you talk a little bit about this concept of when people pivot quickly they they they're not building the muscle of building conviction like what talk to us about that you know we have a few different metaphors I'll mix them so one of the metaphors is what constitutes a high quality rep yes what constitutes completing full pivot cycle yes and to learn anything you need to complete it all the way yes so again like being like we built a product we spammed 10 people on LinkedIn none of them replied let's throw it all in the trash I am arguing that is not a high quality rep no you didn't do anything you didn't really do anything you didn't really learn anything it was sort of just like a waste of everyone's time you did you did spend time so that's you're right okay you wasted time and so congrat the the metaphor I sometimes like to tell people when they're pivoting is the most important customer is yourself and the founder psychology thing you want to do is build conviction in your own mind that this thing is worth working on yes and so it's not to make investors happy or your YC partner happy yes or whatever it's to convince your brain that more time spent on this idea is time well spent another way I like to think about that is to convince yourself this customer is worth helping yeah like you're going to enjoy spending time with this customer and I find a lot of Founders kind of want to skip that part yeah oh I just want to be in this industry I just want to I just want them to buy my thing I don't want I don't like like don't talk to me I don't really care about just buy my thing make my number go up and I want to raise my series a it's like and and so in terms of like founder personality traits or things you can develop I think a lot of times how good of a programmer you are is one thing how good you are at sales how good you are at fundraising all these things are like you know important yes but someone that has low conviction and struggles to ever build conviction on anything even if they're great at all those other factors not going to make it isn't that crazy versus there's people that are worse at some of those other things imagine this this was like a baseball card of their skills not the best programmer not the best salesperson not the best fundraiser but very high conviction and able to focus their energy One Direction in a superhuman way those people to have succeed case in point Justin Khan my co-founder I I totally agree and what's funny is like every good startup team has at least one of those people you need one yes yes you need that and and the too cool for school teams where it's like oh no like I can't I can't be to into anything right like my bar is super high it's like sorry you'll just you'll pivot to you run out of speed right and and so like let's talk about exactly what conviction means I think it doesn't mean believing in things religiously exactly it's more of not letting yourself get blown off course so this happens to us a lot we've seen this at YC a Founder is working on an idea that it's going well they go to fundraise the fundrais is hard what happens if you're not high conviction y got to Pivot got they give up so if just meeting with investors causes you to give up causes you to give up on your idea by definition I'm arguing you don't have high conviction yes because you're blown off course if every time you talk to a new customer you decide to change your product that is low conviction you do not have conviction let's go back to the investor one the thing that I hate about that investor one is that if you look at the history of really big companies so many of them most investors thought that the idea was horrible yes so it's like empirically a lot of investors thinking your idea is horrible is not necessarily a bad sign correct yeah it's not necessarily a good sign either by the way we're not arguing hey if it's bad then it must be good we're not seeing that it it's more of a neutral like it's it's it's it's not a key indicator either way I might arue but when you take it as a key when it's the only key indicator yeah oh it's so it's almost like when you spend all your time trying to triangulate what other people say is good and that's how you decide what startup idea to work on yeah you're going to have a bad time so I think that um I've been trying to unpack hack why do people do this and and more specifically like why do people kind of think logically and rationally in their job and then come to their startup and just their quality of thinking decreases by 90% And you know you have I talked about this before you know a big thing is fear and in the context of the YC batch I noticed a big thing specifically related to fear is I literally like fake information you know I had a company told me like oh man well we started looking at this problem and realized it was going to take a little while to build and you know we looked at our batch and 75% of the companies already have launched products that are growing and we were like we can't and I'm like wait wait wait wait pause I was like he said it with such conviction for a second I was like wow that's a good job we're killing 75% already launched the badge hasn't started yet and then I was like wait like why do you like why do you think that and they were like I just assumed I was like just making up yeah and I was like you can look well and this is what's funny for the founders that read a lot of Twitter or Reddit or blogs is they will take something you know Anonymous arvar 42 said as like gospel and base their entire life philosophy around it yes don't do that don't do that especially when you can look up the real answer like you can tell which company like when you're in the y b you can tell which companies are launched which ones aren the other one was well an Alum told me I won't be able to raise without you know $10,000 in Mr and it was interesting because I had to sit down with this founder and say really simply some companies enter the batch with a post-launch product with users some companies will enter the batch with an idea if you were a rational investor would you judge those two different companies with the same exact rubric they of course not and I was like okay and if an investor did would you not call them kind of dumb and maybe wouldn't want to work with them like yeah so then why are you doing that of course the expectations are different from something that comes into a batch with just an idea but I think that these kind of false expectations yeah create the fear and then the fear creates the bad thinking and then it's like once you're in bad thinking you're you're kind of fine I love that technique uh that you just mentioned I like to do this one sometimes too when someone is trying to get a first customer yeah which is like okay in your past job your team evaluated different software to buy right yes yes and i' be like so you have actually been on the other side of the customer conversations a lot yeah so which of the sales tactics that you're trying would have worked on you like how often do you respond to cold emails on LinkedIn yeah oh never okay with name kind of poorly replaced in the template is that like and suddenly their brain the gears in their brain re-engage with like oh we evaluated things all the time and we would do this and I had the like like and i' be like so basically you're actually an expert at understanding your customer because you bought a lot of software on the other side of the table yes what if you just tried to come up with with tactics that would have worked on you and would have made you buy your product and they'll like stop and be like I've never thought of that before yeah and so that's actually actually a really great technique is to remember back when you've been on the buy side for stff yes and think about what have appealed to what would have appealed to you or got you over the line and then that screens out a lot of this junk because the low effort pivots if you run the thought experiment they'd be like oh yeah I would never buy this I think what's so funny is like when the founder has that realization oh I actually am an expert in this like oh I can actually lean on my expertise the thing I often say next is like and that's why we funded you like yeah like it's like almost like they didn't realize that we funded them because they knew something about the topic they were pitching and then when they want to Pivot really clack we're like wow now you're moving into an area you know nothing about and we have to like hey remember like remember you know you knowu here like others will respect that too like your customers so no I think this is um it's so tricky cuz fear really just everything but I do think this is one of the reasons why um I like the new YC standard deal because I think that before Founders would be like well if I don't reason demid I'm and now I can just say to them it's like look imagine no raise in Dem you have half a million dollars you're fine like there is no gun the only gun to your head is the one you're lifting because you keeping over and over again and you never build conviction like when you're low conviction yeah money ain't going to money's not your problem so sometimes it's like hey Founders just put the gun down all right so we often encounter these companies and we've talked about this before companies that get into pivot itis right and got a bad case bad case of pivot itis right and I think what's interesting is that like a company that will build something learn over a period of time and then pivot will often pivot from a place of knowledge and like actually continue to make forward progress but we also see uh uh a different version H how would you describe that version yeah have you heard the term random walk people like so Random walk is where you use like a random number generator to decide which direction you go and basically when you random walk you actually never get anywhere like imagine a starting point and then you walk one direction and you roll the dice and you choose a different direction you do that over and over again yep you never get anywhere that's kind of like emailing 25 startups and asking them if they like your idea a little bit it's a little random right doing that again and then doing that again and doing that yeah and and what happens is imagine you're like you know a rowboat in the middle of the ocean trying to get back to land if you just keep changing direction every every once in a while you're never going to get you're going to be lost at sea and so you kind of have to get on a vector that even if you have to change a little bit yeah there's some forward progress you're making in some specific Direction and I think that what we see that's so unfortunate is that when you do that random walk enough you just run out of energy Y and you know I always see it like somewhere in like one and a half to two years if you don't feel like you've learned anything and you've spent two years kind of doing the thing one your experience isn't going to be good no two you won't feel like use the time well but three you're just going to be tired and for no good reason you can be tired for no good reason and well you've never sunk your teeth in anything so it's like you're you feel like you've been running a race but that if it's like so what have you learned they're like well learn what not to do yeah like it's harder it's kind of harder to articulate why that was a good use of your time yes no and I think that what's sad is that oftentimes those people have a very bad memory of startups right yeah and um I wish they didn't like the folks who learned and didn't succeed are often motivated to go out and do it again or go work in a company in that space like this is an additive experience in their life even if their shut up didn't work the ones who do the random walk like they realize man this probably wasn't a good use of my time so anyways I think that the last point I always like to bring up here is another version of this kind of random walk or email 25 people then pivot is like launch a product that will help no one yep and then pivot and and in the Founder's mind they'll say well I launched an MVP and nobody wanted it and you know we talked about this earlier it's like is it an MVP MVP is one of those terms where we people say it so much it's assumed that there's an agreed upon definition yeah but when you ask for details I am not convinced there's an agreed upon definition of MVP so what's your definition of MVP well you know I I think that I used to not assume I had to define it narrowly but now that I think about it if you can't get anyone to use your MVP it's probably not an MVP well it's not the V we're missing the V which is viable yeah like basically if it doesn't work for anyone yeah how it is hard to argue that is viable no and like shouldn't an MV it seems like the cool thing about an MVP is you can do things that don't scale and cheat like you can make it you can kind of will it to work for one person right so the fact that it doesn't work for one person usually means that like you weren't even trying to make it work for them like you were trying to do something else this is a this is something that comes up a lot when I'm reading applications or in interviews for specifically developer tools you ready yeah it'll be like oh cool so I built this tool and it helps your code and you're way more efficient and it's better and it's you know we're building our MVP and like we're getting we're we're emailing people on LinkedIn now yeah what is the question I asked Michael do do you use it yourself yes I will say great so tell me about your usage of it yeah and they'll be like they'll be like okay so let me get this straight this is helping programmers and you're out selling it you're trying to get stone cold strangers to use it but it's not good enough for you to use yet right and then is that what you're were saying usually there like well it doesn't have like they can list the thing well it doesn't have this this and I mean like I would never use it and so the argument the earnest point is you should at least be able to use your own tool yes and be proud to use it or feel like it's providing some value the V and the it's viable for you yes and if you can't even get your you can't bring yourself to use your own product it's a little weird to be trying to sell it to people more than a little more than a little weird and so that should be the bar for a lot of folks is that they are willing to use their own product yes right that's a good bar for especially I mean if it's solving your own problem then like at a minimum yeah that doesn't apply there's some that doesn't apply in some cases but for a lot of things at a minimum you should should be able to use it so yes so once we started looking at it this way I started realizing like how many companies never build an MVP cuz that that's like it's typically seen as kind of like the first real baby step right and how many folks never get there they never made one customer happy and sometimes when I talk to Founders who have these big high fluen plans like I bring it back to like can we just one can we just go one you know the path to 10 million happy users yeah let's talk about that later for today how about one one and you know you can't do that like you can you can everyone can do that yeah so um maybe the long story short here is that one it's going to take maybe longer than you think so don't have expectations that screw you up two fear makes you think real bad like don't let fear turn a really smart person into a not very smart person three man it helps to solve your own problem and then to be your first customer that's a good bar at least you could say you did that you know if you're doing a random vog maybe start with um and then four like understand that like you're got to do you called it a good rep make the analogy because in lifting like make the analogy yeah I think it would just be um in any kind of exercise or movement if you want to build strength you want to like have good form yeah and you won't get better if your form is bad or you might even injure yourself actually right like if you want to learn I don't know how to swing a golf club yep and your form is bad a you probably won't learn and B you might injure yourself yeah and you're not going to have fun you're definitely not going to have fun so you kind of want to have good form yeah when you're trying to do something that's hard run a good rep I like it all right man great chat cool thanks
