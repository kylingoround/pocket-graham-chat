headline ripped from the news is people looking at the corporate structure of open AI Y and being like oh this is an interesting this is an instruction [Music] manual all right welcome to Dalton plus Michael today we're going to talk about how do you avoid innovating on the wrong things so to set this up right we're in the Innovation economy oh definitely major major Innovation it's right here Innovation economy that's what's happening we encounter a lot of Founders who believe that they need to take what I call Innovation juice and spread it across Innovation juice when I'm trying to insult it and they have to spread it across every freaking problem they encounter and I think that there's only a limited amount of innovation energy that any company can have there's only so much juice is what you're saying it's like I set that up and and we have maybe encountered some places where um you should maybe just use the best practices what you think here's how I think about this making a startup work yep is a miracle yes yes and the fact that you got product Market fit and made something people want you you literally performed a miracle to do that it is amazing people would are so you know people would die to get where you got yep now the odds that you are going to be able to perform five Miracles at once is much much much lower much lower and so you want to focus the Miracle Juice on the single Miracle which is making something people want and making a product right you guys see what I'm saying and so solving real customer problem and then all this other stuff yes yeah just do best practices please don't innovate yes like you don't need to have a low likelihood of success Miracle like you don't want to have to be right on these long shot bets yes five different ways yes and I think it's interesting because I think that I encounter some people who somehow are more religious about these side bets right it's like well I'll only do a startup if I can locate it in Bumble nowhere or I'll only do a startup if um I get to do this weird corporate governance thing or and I'm like what you're really saying is like I'll only serve my customer and help them with the really important problem in their life if I get this other random thing that the customer doesn't give two shits about right and it always kind of blows my mind it's like it's it's in some ways business is really about being selfless and like putting your customer first but it's like I'll only put my customer first if I get to locate this startup in New York and I'm like that's obviously putting yourself first I think let's start with the most common anti-patterns we see sure right like what is the one what what are the ones you see the most man what's what's offender number one of where people are trying to innovate where they probably shouldn't be I I would say one that I see on the YC application that I love is when it's like some kind of weird incorporation yes so you know we incorporated it as a Wyoming LLC and I'm like this was a voluntary red flag like this is like yeah wh why would you do that and like sometimes they'll even write well because like and you're just like well I think my theory is there's a lot of smart people again they want to inv in different ways and they'll look at something like corporate law and the existence of the Delaware SE Corp and be like I someone that knows nothing about this could do better yes yes obviously so and everyone else is doing Delaware SE corpse that's not for me I'm going to do a and then crazy things happen yes right and so probably corporate governance is not the best place to innovate one thing that's been funny um headline ripped from the news is people looking at the corporate structure of open AI Y and being like oh this is an interesting this is an instruction manual um a nonprofit that owns a for-profit would not recommend that strategy even the people that work working there I mean even Sam himself has uh suggested that that was perhaps not the wisest choice and so again the point here is the miracle of making something people want is the hard part yeah but if you're just doing like a startup you know where C Corps are pretty good yeah you know I see another one because you know corporate governance that covers you know your investment docks and where you're in corporating and all that kind of stuff your vesting blah blah blah your your classes of shares like I sometimes see Founders doing crazy stuff I see another one that you brought up though which I really love is the like I'm going to make this startup but I'm also going to disprove every piece of startup advice like I love this like I'm only willing to help my customer if I can simultaneous L prove that all of the startup advice is incorrect yes it's like what like and so yeah so the example of that is just to take something that is like widely considered useful or true yeah and try to prove the opposite of it yes you know like my thing will be Reliant upon making the small town that I live in the center of the startup ecosystem or something like somehow there'll be other some other bet they're making yes that involves a super contrarian thing that has nothing to do actually I can think you an example of these by the way yes one of these was I remember a Founder doing something unrelated again I'll keep this Anonymous yeah but they were like the real thing the real bet we're trying to make is the hydrogen economy and that no one will use gasoline or solar or wind or or or but then in the future we're going to use hydrogen everywhere there like H hey man maybe don't mention that like we'll keep this between maybe when you're that's the real secret maybe you should keep that maybe you should keep that on the on the down low again like in the case was like maybe he's right but had nothing to do with the actual bet of the startup no and to try to throw in this long shot bet that we're all going to be using hydrogen for everything again maybe he's right I don't know that seemed like a completely unnecessary risk or thing to innovate on yeah and I and I think that what's so sad about these things is that um I think there's a misunderstanding of how hard it is to make something that people want where people think that they have these extra points this extra juice to spread to to do other things with and I just I I always like to tell people it's like this game is so hard without this stuff like why do you want the game to be harder like I never understood that is it fun yeah well okay let me example something that's fun okay sure like nerd bait kind of stuff sure again I I this is my recollection recollection is that when I believe it was Asana when they started they wrote their own programming language of course first of course and why would you do that because it's fun I believe they back that out again someone will correct me if I'm wrong on this but um a lot of times choosing very idiosyncratic programming languages or text acts y people choose to do it because it's fun and who am I to F for that but like that's like it's like they're optimizing for like wouldn't be cool if we wrote our entire thing in this new idiosyncratic programming language yeah that's such a weird it's like I get it on one hand and your startup should be fun right like you're be doing it for a while I get it on one hand but I've never seen a Founder who didn't have the most fun by helping their customer do you remember in the Reddit versus Dig Wars dig made a lot of technical bets along these lines like meaning like they made a lot of very high risk technology choices while Reddit was just like not let's make a social news site that well I don't think they were taking any highrisk Tech choices and so this again is an example where dig was taking on all this extra risk on something that had nothing to do with dig.com loading news stories no it was it was literally about the Technologies they were choosing to power the website yes well and the one I remember was when they did the revision and they couldn't roll it back when their site didn't work yes that is correct yeah they redesigned everything all the time it was really impressive I think the other thing that comes up a lot around Innovation is business model and pricing yep and I think this once again is not putting the customer first you know hey let's say you're selling Cloud compute right your customers are probably bought AWS before maybe you should charge like AWS does right because maybe your customers will recognize that and that will give them Comfort yep no that's wrong we hate AWS we can't do anything like AWS including pricing so now your customer looks at this pricing thing and they're like well I really like your product but I don't I don't understand your pricing page doesn't make sense like it's not even that they don't want to pay it's that they they're like I don't understand what you're saying or how this works no I have to buy floel and then I get credits for floel and then I transfer them into the like like super yes and by the time I'm at that page I just want to know what it costs and if I can't figure out what it cost like how how do I you you I'm walking you invited me in your home and then you've shot me in the L no I you find me in your home and I can't open the front door like the door handle like I don't I don't know how to use your door handle and I really wanted to come in I did I was I was game I had my my money I was ready to buy something so I think that like um so much of this kind of Pop entrepreneur shark tanky advice right I actually think comes from a different place I think it actually comes from like weird branding and like I think that like in The Branding world like being different being unique like like that is like a very very important thing and like a lot of the examples in The Branding world are people who did things like radically different and then like became successful what I find funny is that a lot of the examples in the technology world are people who did things 80% the same and 20% at at least 80% 80% was the was the minimum that they copied yeah and so I think one of the things that's Founders screw up is when they take advice that might work in fashion and apply it to yeah software because yeah this this reminds me of usability if people can't use your thing like I remember back in the day people would try to innovate on on the website design and how the cursor worked and like how you would even click buttons and that was an example of probably not helpful innovation no um and so watch out for unintentionally creating risk that you don't need to create yeah and and I think that if you put your first your customer first second and third you might look at some of these other things and say do I really need to do them or better yet let me do it on my second startup let's get let's get one success will start up out of the way and then I can make programming languages I can hire people all around the world I can do all kinds of crazy I can build Rockets I can do all kinds of cool things yeah startup number two all right toson good chat [Music] thanks
