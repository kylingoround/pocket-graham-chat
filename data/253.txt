I cannot wait for the day where my daughter and son say like oh 45 minutes to Tokyo that's so slow I can't wait hello this is Dalton post Michael and today we're going to talk about why are we optimistic about the future so to be clear at YC we fund a lot of startups and even though we try to do a very good job most startups fail yeah if you look at the numbers we know a lot more about failing and failed startups yes than successful ones by in order magnitude yeah yeah that's just how the numbers work right and so we see failed startups every day we live it we breathe it this is just the this is the job that we have is we're experts on failure well and just so you don't think oh well you know they're going to be optimistic because they're like rolling in the dough the ones that work take like 12 years to work right so it's like even for the ones that do well like you don't make money fast being an early stage startup investor so why is a situation where it takes a long time to make money and a lot of startups are dying all around us every day why are we optimistic I I think it's this I think if you zoom all the way back all the way out it's weird to talk to young people and have them be pessimistic about the future yes it's weird it is weird and so part of the reason you know we want to do this video is to give you some reasons to be optimistic yourself yes and I think it comes down to perspective Michael yes I think it's all about perspective where if all you do is read the news every day you get bombarded with negativity especially around technology yes there's a lot of the biggest technology stories right now are some version of like this is bad these people are bad like I people are being exploited bad bad bad bad right and so it's not hard if you're just consuming the news and not zooming out to be like yeah you know things were better back 50 years ago or 100 years ago don't point to me I was inong you know um and I I'm again I'm not sure that's true I think there's a perspective thing so again like so walk with us here let's let's talk about perspective yes let's talk about the things that have improved since the 9s when we were like teenagers yes let's go through list we we we we thought through the list right so the '90s were supposed to be boom time America and if we think about what's better now than the 90s I think I would start with like availability of information I remember in the mid 90s getting the CD ROM called incarta yep and I remember my uncle who's 20 years older than me being like Oh my God the encyclopedi is in your house versus having to go to the Library this is incredible you could just search it it was on one disc exactly it was easy to search and like that now God knows how much more information than that is like for free the interet everything it's textual information is a search away yes and video freaking YouTube itself crazy there's a website where anyone can record any video of like any length on any topic for free and you can watch it for free forever that is like mindblowing to me yes how incredible this is again if you zoom out if you think like you're an alien and you you just have no context on this stuff yes this is incredible incredible and none of this existed well and this isn't like we're not talking about 50 years ago right we're talking about like 20 25 years ago Yep this didn't exist right all right next Communications uh I don't know about you but we started with one phone line in the house yep and that's it that was communication again people like well but it was must been so great there were no phones and like it was so much easier to be a teenager and all that I mean no maybe maybe no it wasn't great like you know you couldn't be like on the internet and on the phone at the same time I don't know if anyone's everever taken that for granted like so now when people like you know I open up the messaging app folder on my phone and there's like 17 apps with video audio text I can text people all over the world for free I can call people anywhere in the world for free like that better it's like a lot better it used to cost money we living in New Jersey it used to cost money to call New York right next door you got to talk fast when you call that was long distance so yeah so Communications a little better transportation freaking Uber ride sharing travel crazy Maps do you remember printing out Map Quest dude do you remember just having to buy Maps physical maps to drive around a city and your dad would have a bunch of maps in the car for all the places you might want to drive to in the future so uh trans station's gotten a little better yeah a little better uh what else has gotten better healthare I mean people are living longer they're living Better Lives yes standard of care infant mortality yes life expectancy around the world people making more money being raised out of the poverty line I mean just look at all the stats you can look it up viewer um actually like Zoom all the way up out and look at this stuff for yourself yes it's pretty cool the number of people living in extreme poverty is less the number of kids living longer once again we're not talking about the difference between like the Civil War era and today this was like 20 30 years ago this isn't even our whole lifetime yep we're half of our lifetime all right what else so we got entertainment yeah I mean think about there's like an infinite supply of things to look at all day infinite infinite any movie you want to see any television show ever created any book ever created if want to Pirate things like if we include piracy in here the sum of all human creative content in the history of time is available at your fingertips for free yes and the only thing limitated is your willingness to go find it yes like it's it's your appetite is the limiting factor not you might have to watch Dems yeah you might have to watch but there's no it's post scarcity on this stuff your the only limiting is your imagination of what you want to watch exactly it's all there okay so we're we sound like Boomers here but the point theas reason to enumerate this stuff is that in the moment when all this stuff was happening it wasn't immediately obvious that the world was changing it was just kind of normal like oh this new thing came out oh that's cool and even at the time some of this stuff was uh people were against it or they're like this doesn't seem so great no and but when you gain perspective of a looking back 20 30 years later it's way more obviously Earth shatteringly awesome yes and so well and I think what's cool is that that wasn't a a particularly special period of time I think they were on the cusp of a bunch of new interesting stuff right um you know hilariously like I remember when starlink was like an idea yeah and it was kind of a funny Idea Internet access anywhere going to satellites and it was like theoretically it's possible but it was I just remember it being like well first Elon has to figure out how to make his Rockets not explode but once he does that he's just going to launch satellites around the earth have I I remember that being like oh sure and then like I remember the day starlink launched I was like I guess the rockets work it it works yes like you can use it you can use it Cruise perfect example I remember getting into a cruise car with Kyle driving down 101 and he said to me uhoh there's a shadow in the road uh let's see how we handle this and I'm like I oh  this is an MVP Shadows a haven't thought about that yeah I haven't thought about shadows in ever when driving and I remember when Cruz did their kind of first open launch and I got into a cruise car with my wife and it just drove us to where we were going and I remember for the first minute 30 being like I can't believe this is the same yeah I can't believe this is on like a Continuum that started with me being afraid of Shadows and now it's like well and again I I actually care about that stuff a lot if I just think about you know growing up about just the number of people that I knew that died in car accidents and the number of people that every day get seriously injured or die in car accidents I think we're going to look back and be like that was crazy barbaric that was like having surgeons that didn't wash their hands lit and that era is I think how we'll look at some of this Transportation stuff yes right and we're right on the precipice it's not like everyone's even excited about self-driving car like it's like oh I don't know about this whole self-driving car thing drunk drivers aren't that bad are they it's only tens of thousands people would die a year in America it's like whatever and so you should I would expect people to be like pretty excited about this yeah but it's seen as sort of this like neutral or divisive issue instead of something that's kind of awesome it's happening I mean another one's renewable energy I I had a friend who was working on a startup and he said something to me that I thought was a lie he was like oh yeah based on like where you live in America you can choose to just buy your energy from like a renewable source like hydroelectric or solar and I was just like it doesn't exist he's like yeah it's and I'm like oh well it must be like 10x more expensive he's like no like right now it's I think like 10% more expensive and I was like what like that it's that's happening like we went from solar being the future in the 90s to just being the commonplace reality that no one thinks too much about and and it and it feeling economical for a lot of people it's like oh you live in a sunny area yeah you're going to save some money it did not feel that way in the we're in a solar powered building right now like like and this is solar power powering this lighting it's there's solar panels on the roof okay whatever do we care no no it's like it's happening right now so you know and to me the one that's like we're probably a little bit more off the cusp on but like when this happens I'm going to be so pissed right everyone talks about rockets and going to space the whole like when Rockets are reliable you can go anywhere in the world in 45 minutes like we could commute to Tokyo yep like when that happens like it changes the world in so many ways and that was like in the 9s we were watching space shuttles yeah go up and like half of the  in that space shuttle basically like getting ejected into the freaking ocean and whenever you did the math it was like oh that cost us more than building a rocket from scratch and blowing it up like that's where we were in the 90s and now like we actually have a path to I can go anywhere in 45 minutes like it's pretty cool and again what this makes me think of I don't have this graph handy so I hope I'm not misquoting but I remember the graph being references of the cost per pound to put something in space and it looks like Moors law where what's happening is that there's this Moors law looking graph yeah on how cheap how much cheaper it is getting to put something into orbit yes and how if you just believe in the Moors law continuing to happen here the amount of cool stuff that will happen in space in 5 10 20 years it's just mindblowing yeah and we're at we're at that it's getting really cool yes so I think what's so cool is like not only have things gotten so much better since the 990s things are getting better so if all of this stuff's great why are people so pessimistic well I think it's hard to have perspective man yes I think when you're really caught up in the moment everything gets polarized into political stuff or tribal Warfare about who's on what team and so if if your team is the thing pushing for the thing you celebrate it but if the other team is screwing people exactly yeah so it's very everything is polarized yes I also think there's this weird expectations game right like it's magical thinking to think that we get all the things we spent the first chunk of the video talking about and there's nothing bad yep that's magical that's like that's not being an adult there's going to be tradeoffs there's going to be trade-offs right like the trade-off on having you know 60-second videos that are EX what I want that I can swipe anytime I want is like you know maybe 2 hours of swiping I should be going to bed you know like there are a lot of different trade-offs and like I just feel like when people treat themselves like children yeah versus treat themselves like adults it's like you know a child doesn't acknowledge a trade-offs exist right a child can think magic they want only the perfect you know it has to all be good with no bad with no bad yes you know cut the crust off exactly cut the crust off right and for a while adults kind of create that world and after a while adults explain to their kids like that's I can't cut the crust off the world or like you need to cut your own crust off I mean if you want to do that you can but I'm I'm not doing that anymore no world is crusted and like you know technology is crusts yeah right technology with the good comes some bad right so that's a big one I also think that like there's this weird thing where the pacing is inconsistent right like um sometimes you get a lot of innovation in one part of the economy economy and then sometimes you get a lot of innovation in another part of the economy it's not reliable yep and so you know and it's so easy it's this it's this de debate thing where you can say well what about X problem like no matter what good thing happens yes and they're not wrong what about like you're right X is a problem like that's totally fair but if if you want to tear down anything interesting that happens by saying well X over here isn't solved yet it's easy to just get trapped in in the mud you tear down everything yeah right so I'll say this right in reflection uh you know we both have young kids and I am super excited that my kids get to grow up now I I I cannot wait for the day where my daughter and son say like oh 45 minutes to Tokyo that's so slow I can't wait you know in my day this isn't so great what's so great about thata it's really Rocky it's really it's a bumpy ride I like I am so excited about the world that they're going to join and I'm confident they're going to get even more over the next you know 80 years than we're getting which is which is really fun and think about it we all you all get to create this future yes and there's this thing where it's cooler and edgier and more punk rock yes to be like everything is and that's a good high horse to be on if you want to be cool but if you're actually building things and you want to be a part of creating it yeah it's much easier and more fruitful to be optimistic and think about all the things you can do and think about what you personally can do and what you can work on yes versus just being like burned it all down because of X well you know think about it if you really care about those problems you have to be optimistic to try to solve them and like some of the people who are like the big social critics or the biggest revolutionaries or the biggest change agents in our society were default optimistic yep because they believed it could work they believed effort wasn't a waste of time you have to believe enough to to invest yourself into something exactly and so I'm only to bet None Of Your Heroes were the cool snarky folks who never did anything and just bitched about how the world was like none of your Heroes were that and so don't be one of those people like you can choose to not be one of those people all right great chat great [Music] thanks
