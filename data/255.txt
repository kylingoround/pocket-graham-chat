you're offering Adventure you're offering the unknown and Adventure isn't here's my idea for a social network for dogs will you build my website no let's build a company together together yes welcome to Doon plus Michael today we're going to talk about why business folks need great technical co-founders so who's this video for Let's talk about the business folks we're talking to yeah I think to set this up um Michael and I both talk to a lot of aspiring Founders in any number of different venues on the street at conferences in interviews wherever like they find us they find us and one of the more common opening lines is something like well I'm a really good business person with a great idea I have the best ideas yes you know how do I need a technical co-founder or how do I find a technical co-founder or I can't find any good technical co-founders like this is one of the number one opening questions we get when we meet people in the real world yes and so this video is aimed at all of those people that ask all these questions that we have met and all the people that haven't met us that might be thinking these questions and what we want to do is give you the key secret to actually being the best business co-founder and we're not going to hide it we're going to put it right up front the best business Founders recruit amazing Technical co-founders and that is how they distinguish themselves that is the number one distinction so it's not what's on your resume where you worked the fact that you were some fancy executive that you're tall people like to go and have drinks with you you've got Amazing Ideas unfortunately there are a lot of folks like that yeah imagine the set of people imagine the intersection there's the set of people that are great business Founders yes and there's the set of people that can recruit amazing technical co-founders yes you want to be in the intersection of those two sets and there's not many people no that puts you in a very special class well and I would I would argue it it is so distinguishing that you're given amazing opportunities um but what's tricky is not only to people not see this um or to people try and not get a Tech Co or they just dismiss it out of hand it's too hard like they'll just kind of like shut this line that's what's even more common it's just that like well I I can't find this person so I'm just going along yeah I don't know anyone okay you know and this is the crazy thing because like a lot of people will pitch this to me as like but this is the true Spirit of an entrepreneurism like no barrier can prevent me from getting my product to market right like I couldn't find technical co-founder so I just moved to the next challenge I hired some Engineers or I got a Dev shop and like nothing will keep me will hold me back back and what's so sad about that way of thinking about it is that like one the percentage chances of death just went through the roof right like you've just completely reduced your chances of success but two I bet if you would put the same amount of effort you put into getting a product to Market without a great technical founder into finding a great technical founder at least half people would be able to do it yeah and so it's just like it's a shame because it's so much wasted Talent yeah I I like to think about it this way again we are what we're talking about implicitly let's make it explicit we're talking about a company that uses software as a deep part of it so Teck software startup if we're talking about a software startup yes and you somehow don't have a technical co-founder this would be like I'm going to build a rocket to the moon yes but no one here knows anything about physics we can my I have such a big heart we can just like like I have such Hustle I'm Johnny hustle I'm going to the Moon Michael like do you see how absurd that is but and the as is okay if you want to start a new clothing brand or a liquor brand okay you don't need this doesn't OB but if you're if you're saying yeah I'm going to build a software company and you don't have a software co-founder it just you're not even in the in the ball game you're not even in the stadium well what's so sad for me is like when I say that to people sometimes they think I'm trying to discourage them but if you go back to that I'm going to prove you wrong Michael I'm going to learn physics yeah and I'm like I am not trying to like I am trying to tell you the number or like I came to you for advice about my product but you're telling me I need a co- you're insulting me Michael yeah yeah and it's just like no I'm trying to give you the most important thing I can tell you and you know what interesting is that like this is advice is informed by my personal experience right like I was the single non-technical person on a forers co-founding team at Justin TV and twitch and like uh I'll just make it plain without my three other co-founders none of that happens like ideas are a dime a dozen and so um I think that more business people need to embrace the idea that great software companies are built by great software Engineers yep a common retort out here is like d we're not building a software business software is in there but it's not that it's a tech enabled yeah we're just building a simple marketplace right like we can just use jedit Marketplace software it's just a copy of door Dash with a little twist why do we need a great software engineer what's your response you know it's hard to win that debate in theory like it's hard to convince someone just in the debate they'll be like well we're just going to agree to disagree yes but I think if you just look at the facts of the companies we funded like literally door Dash or literally Airbnb or any of these folks yes they lived and died by their speed of shipping software and if they what they did was buy white label software or have some Dev shop in a foreign country making edits to the website there's a 0% chance those companies would have worked yeah and so again who am I to say there won't be some future company that maybe uses one of these things yes but the more that the more that we're exposed to seeing what these companies look like at the earliest stages even if they don't look like strictly Tech businesses man there's no way these things would have gotten off the ground without having a really great person who cared as much as a co-founder cares yes building this thing day in and day out versus someone ripping you off charging you $500 an hour to change some words on the website and you don't even know you're not even ball game like it's not even well what what pisses me off is that like I think in other areas um that are equally as hard as being successful Tech founder let's say Athletics I think more people are realistic about it strangely like the equivalent is you know a 5'4 person who doesn't jump can't run yeah and like got a lot of heart mangles yeah they're not that many of those people who are saying to the world I want to be in the NBA right whereas we see the equivalent of that in startups all the time and it's like it's one thing if you're 66 and like you're like a great high school basketball player you probably won't make the NBA but like all right at least you you're in the stadium in the stadium you're amongst the million people who could yeah and I think that people are not honest with themselves and I think what we're trying to do is give you this secret which is that like you can almost get a ticket to being in the game and it requires recruiting one person yep how cool is that like this shouldn't be seen as a negative it like an extreme positive it's like a golden what is it Willy Wonka ticket and and even if you are technical yourself or sometimes people are medium technical like so I I was a technical CEO but I still tremendously benefited by having an additional technical co-founder and so this is also a thing where you're not like okay well I you know I can kind of I can kind of okay that doesn't count there's actually tremendous benefits from having someone again who cares as much as a Founder who's commit as much as a founder and who's at you know at the top of the game like a 10x engineer on a Founder level you're unstoppable and what's weird is sometimes we had competitors in in my startups whose teams were constructed this way horrible Tech talent and it was funny in hindsight because we never had to be worried they could raise more money they could have nicer office they could have more employees they could have cooler people using their it didn't matter like having better engineering is the gift that gives you more shots every day even if you need to Pivot no matter what no matter what happens good or bad you're in a better position a better position to react to these changes yes and I think the even scarier thing about this is that like when you start with a team of business people assessing engineers and they are naturally going to start by hiring worse Engineers all of your future Engineers are exactly it compounds bad so okay so all right Michael all right you guys convinced me I guess whatever but I don't you know sure guy you know I guess that's a point you can make I don't know but Michael I don't know anyone where do I find these people yeah how again that's what we always say in these conversations so how what is your response when they tell you that so the first thing is that like who are you disqualifying and why I can't tell you how many business people told me well I obviously need a CTO with 10 years of experience and who've managed teams of at least 50 to 100 and I'm like you're 23 years old with no years of experience why do you need that and they're like well because you know when we launch this thing's going to get big just like come on so first you might be disqualifying great people don't do that and so let's say you don't know them sometimes the number one thing to do if you're in this position is to not start the company right now is to go get a job at a startup is to go change the people you know and what's so interesting is that like sometimes taking that step sideways is the easiest and best path to starting Journey with the highest likelihood of success well here's the thought experiment I encourage people to do visualize the best person you have ever worked with either in school or in your job the best engineer that everyone knows is the best person yes can you visualize someone okay can you get that person to be your co-founder and often people are like oh yeah no they would never they would never work with me what do you mean man or like they're making lots of money yeah and again I would just stop right there and be like well why have you talked to them and they're like no they would like basically folks put up the barriers yes to negotiate against themselves yes right out of the gate and again if we Zoom all the way out yes so you want to start a company you want to do something big but you won't actually even bother to try to recruit the most obvious person that's a candidate that you know but what if they say no or you talk to them and they're like no I don't think so um what often happens again to go deep on this is that the way they'll pitch the person is they'll pitch them their idea they be like I'm an idea guy I've got a great idea do you want to be my like worker be to go do all my ideas and of course the person that's the best person you've ever worked with does not want to sit in a cage no and do all of the work that you give them no and instead I'm like well have you asked them what if they have startup ideas yeah and then you sell yourself where you can come together come up with the idea together yeah as co-owners and it's shocking how often that appears to have never occurred to someone like they think the idea of finding a tech co-founder is to find someone who will basically submit to their whims and be like their like assistant to find an employee yeah and that's not the move man trying to find a partner you know it's funny because my dad would say this to me about my co-founder Justin Khan he was like you know Michael Justin's an amazing recruiter and I always thought I was like what's weird is like I think if you're recruited by a good recruiter you don't even realize they're a good recruiter right but like in hindsight I'm like all right so we got me Emmit and Kyle to work for him well not work for him but to be his co-founders in a startup where he was wearing a camera on his side streaming his live 247 named after him yes named after named Justin.tv do you want to work up my startup yes it's me yes and and and he had raised 50,000 seems like a great deal Michael yeah right and so it's like okay well like how did he build that team like you know it comes back to like you want to sting yourself as a business person go do that like that's people should be impressed I'm impressed you're a great business and hey they're working on your idea let's even I promise you I have no idea well I you know I'll tell you what he promise me it wasn't that the idea was going to work like it was the adventure okay it was the adventure and like I think what's so interesting when people like don't ask their friend and they assume oh but they work at this company they're never going to do it da D it's like they don't realize you're offering Adventure you're offering the unknown an adventure isn't here's my idea for a social network for dogs will you build my website no let's build a company together together yes that's Adventure yes and um what's crazy is like when you're pitching Adventure there aren't a lot of there aren't a lot of Alternatives most people don't have six Adventures on the play how often does any one person get pitched Adventure yeah I know it's usually Adventure or like so you know it's a good pitch it's a good pitch so anyways right I think that um we're trying you know I think that there's like I'll say this right I'm a business guy right I think YC has a lot of messaging that's like yeah our business guy is important D like you don't need them I agree you don't need them but I will say this um there are a lot of very successful non-technical people in our Network that do amazing work and I think one of the things that if you want to learn from them we're trying to give you one of the most important patterns we see from those folks they're great recruiters and they they do this thought experiment of who's the best person in the world and they find a way to get that person to work with them that's bending the universe to your will is what that is so you should hold yourself to their standard and maybe you'll get their success all right thanks D [Music] thanks
