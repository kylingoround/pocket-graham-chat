as far as you can tell the metrics are excellent yes the founders are extremely focused yes your colleagues are very smart and you are very impressed continuing to work with them yes you should probably stay a really long time yeah I mean like that's that's kind of what Google looked like what Facebook looked like welcome to Dalton and Michael today we'd like to do a followup on a video that we recorded a year ago that video was why you should leave your Fang job we all know these people that want to just tell you their darkest secret which is they wake up every day and they like dream of quitting like they have fantasies of quitting every day those are people that probably should quit this video is why maybe you should leave your failing unicorn startup o tricky topic and let's say signals we don't know we don't have all the information but there might be some hints there might be some signs you want to be looking for that it might be time to reach greener pastures and if you're an employee of one of these companies you probably have the best perspective a better perspective than investors maybe sometimes even better perspective than Founders yes on what's really going on so maybe we should start this by saying there are 1,400 unicorns now is that right yeah wow well I'll ask you I don't know what you think do you think all 1400 will go public successfully I think the odds are pretty slim that they're all doing amazing yeah I think that's I think that's a fair statement I think that's a fair statement and so if you kind of divide this out even if you're really optimistic like what what do you think an optimistic count what percentage of the 1400 we're being super optimistic they do an IPO and everyone's really happy third I'm just making this up a third thirdd third great so in that case 2third of that 1400 it it's not going to work out and I think what's unfortunate is that like when things don't work out employees usually don't they are yeah and the who takes one for the team they're usually in the category take one for the team right um and again like brass tax sh what what this means is your Equity most likely if you joined a unicorn that is late stage y the um strike price of your options is going to be tied to the valuation that the company raised at yep and so if the company is sold for less or if it's perhaps overvalued your options are likely underwater right this is just simple fact of life and often the people running these companies don't love this line of questioning and so we're just sort of telling you the truth which is you know the later you joined a company the higher your strike price will be on options and so the folks that are most likely most of the people W hired at the end of the you know when they became unicorns a lot of people came in so the strike prices are very high yes and so man you just you need to be smart yes well and the second thing is if they do end an acquisition and many will end an acquisition um oftentimes you have to reinie for your job like often times they don't want to bring everyone over in the acquisition and so that's tricky and also you might end up at a the big tech company you were running away from that's right um when you're doing a startup so I think I I I'd love to put in a kind of a little bit of a a note here I think that those 30% that will do well um will probably do counterintuitively well like I think like really well yeah like very well extremely well even going to work at those companies now is probably a good idea absolutely yeah and so I think that's what's so tricky about this is you have to be smart you can't really be like following the press or stuff that yeah or like the memes on Twitter about what's doing well and not doing well no you got to attack let's be specific so Michael what would you do if you were an employee say you were a software engineer yes at a unicorn yes how what what would be the signals you'd be looking for to know if this was like a smart move to stay I think the first thing I'd be thinking about is revenue I would say that in the end of the day um when a market when a company goes public or when a company is acquired for a lot of money um the market is looking at how much revenue that company is making and is that Revenue growing and I would say that you know for example if I'm at a company right now that's making 50 to 100 million in revenue or more um that's a unicorn like that's pretty good yeah that's it's it's reasonable that it's a unicorn if they have 100 million plus in Revenue okay that's that pencil's out right that's pretty good um I think that if I'm work if I'm like working at a company as like 50 million or less in revenue and as a unicorn now I'm starting to ask myself the question do users like the product what's retention look like are we charging as much as because we could could we charge more do we actually have product Market fit do we actually have product Market fit again not likely to be a popular question in management if you ask management this but yeah worth considering and I think a lot of these questions can really be answered by looking at what are the customers doing right I I I think what's so funny is that if you're an employee inside of a company most likely information you need to tell what the company doing well or not is like literally available to you yeah well and I could imagine there actually maybe some folks out there that work at companies where the information is not available to them is that okay like what do you think is that normal to not I would what's interesting is that maybe um there's certain financials or certain you know cash on hand or something that it's important for the company or a Founder might decide to keep private but I would I would say in most companies product analytics in some way or another is available yep is like widely available and so you can tell whether the users who are paying for your product are actually engaging with it and and man I think that's like hilariously the simple leading indicator of whether you have a good product is you sold somebody the product they've successfully onboarded and they're actively using it and then and they renew on the business model of the company hey they keep using it and they keep paying for it forever what we also need to attack is this idea that because smart investor invested my company's doing well yep like I just don't I think that you know when you're the press or when you're on the outside having to judge you have to use these kind of weird secondary Revenue focused all your only signal as an outsider is fundraising rounds yeah and there there can be companies that are still struggling that aren't going to make it they still somehow raising money one trick by the way friends out there that's very common is a fundraising round may have happened a year ago but they're choosing to announce it now yes and it looks like they just raised and that is not true yes so watch watch out for using the announcements of fundraising yes as a is a very reliable signal yes so Michael in terms of Market timing one thing that might be interesting to think about if you're currently working at a at a unicorn a very late Stage Company uh is now might be a good time to consider going to an earlier Stage Company as an employee yes because it's less likely their Equity is super overvalued and there's lots of room for advancement so how would you think about this if you were an employee one of these companies well one I'd think that you know you've gathered a lot of experience and so you might have an opportunity to have more responsibility to an early stage company um which would also probably get you more Equity um I would say too you could use many of the hints that we gave you to judge that early stage company and you can actually do a bit of a comparison yep to get a Vibe for like oh like this really Stage Company seems like it's doing better than my L Stage Company and I think the third thing is that um what's funny is I think it's a little counterintuitive right it's the it's the moment where your friends are gonna be like that's stupid like yeah why would you go to a smaller company that's not a unicorn exactly right and it's it's so weird in my life how many times the dumb move at the moment was the smart move later and vice versa like it is just over and over again yeah and so the the dream setup is you go to an earlier Stage Company that has the same Revenue as the Unicorn you were leaving and on10th the valuation does your option strike price is much better and more responsibility you have more responsibility that's a pretty good trade that's not a bad trade at all that's not a bad trade at all um and of course you could always start a company as well which is just the Uber version of the same trade exactly yeah so I think the what I would say is this is that you know this is tricky right I think that when we made the video about Fang fortunately or unfortunately I think that you know Google is going to look very similar five years from now as it looks now yep and I think that that for those of you who are at unicorns um it can really go either way so you have to be careful right you could leave a unicorn and that company could do great and you could look back five years from now and say like I made the exact wrong decision on the flip side you could be the person you know shutting the lights off and five years from now being like I I'm not making the right decision so make sure that you're actually doing your own analysis here I think is the point I want to make like make sure you're doing first principles analysis you're looking at data you're you're not believing any hype I I think another point to make is the concept of job hopping job hopping is not good either so sometimes you'll see people that swap they go to a new unicorn every 12 months or 18 months it's very hard to ever build a good career or to build expertise or even make a lot of money make a lot of money doing that kind of stuff so again I don't want folks to interpret what we're saying as hey you should be a job offer and just no switch jobs the to the extent you are working in a place where as far as you can tell the metrics are excellent yes the founders are extremely focused yes your colleagues are very smart and you were very impressed continuing to work with them yes you should probably stay a really long time yeah I mean like that's R kind of what Google looked like Facebook look like and and so again just to go through things I would look at if I were someone in one of these companies trying to decide if my company was doing well yes all the stuff Michael said but other signs that be looking for is do the found seem checked out are they in the office maybe you don't have an office uh maybe a remote company but like does it actually seem like Senior Management is like engaged engaged and in reality sometimes when a when a unicorn is doing poorly management will just completely be on Mars yes like the numbers will all be bad but they'll be like oh we're doing better than ever like that kind of CRA we work isn't a classic example of this so you should actually be looking at Senior Management and the founders and just and make a judgment if you think they seem like they're competent yeah and again this is different sometimes the Press lionizes people that aren't super competent the Press shouldn't be involved in this decision so you should make your own decision it should be like is the the message in the All Hands line up with the facts that you see yeah does it do it seem credible yeah I also would look at what the rest of the people that work at the company seem like and do they all seem busy and do they have enough to work to do yes and do you just feel like your colleagues are good yes cuz one signal of a company that's going that's not going well is that everyone good is kind of left and the people that are left are just doing make work to try to not get laid off there kind of a malaise yeah and often the founders of these companies won't want to you know do layoffs or whatever to keep the fiction going that the company's going well yeah and so again I think you can make judgment you know hopefully you're correct but of just how good do your colleague seem and how much do they have really important work to do that's serving customers versus going through the motions making pitch decks or slide decks or whatever it is that people do at companies on well right and so I think these are really you have the information if you're inside of the company you have all the information way better than anyone else does yes and um and again if if this could all check out and you're like you know what this is going great and I really like my colleagues and I'm learning a lot and I should double down I should work harder I should try to get more Equity so yeah maybe that's the message that we want to leave is that um unfortunately amongst these 1400 they're all going to make it unfortunately this unicorn label does not mean you're going to get in the money yep and you've got to think critically and like that's isn't that life yeah and and in a lot of life is you could be disappointed because other authority figures told you something is true yeah the authority figure said this company raised a lot of money it's a very good bet it's the next whatever yeah but ultimately those authority figures aren't going to be around if it doesn't work out and if there Au it's you and if those authority figures are investors they're hedged yeah they're hedged so maybe every YC unicorn is going to make it everyone every single one you heard it here every single one Dalton's personal guarantee all right great chatting [Music] thanks [Music]
