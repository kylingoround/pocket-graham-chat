most mere mortals out in the world need to do step one and can't skip to step two even though step two sounds cooler yes beer myrtles including Elon including literally Elon himself was a mere mortal all right this is Dalton plus Michael and today we're going to talk about why it's so hard to copy your Heroes set this up for us Dalton yeah um there's a common Dynamic that that we see um in our industry yes where a prominent person will give advice that sounds reasonable you know like they're just saying they're just giving people advice but it is not at all what they did to become successful it's the classic do as I say not as I do or in this case past tense do as I say not as I did yes and um it always gets a little bit tricky for us when we when we witness this well it's super weird because we're just getting old enough we're for a lot of these people we saw what they did yeah we know their story yeah we know their story and so we're just like that's weird you didn't do that yeah that wasn't at all your path yeah and so you're telling everyone to do something yeah that wasn't the thing you did but what's weird is that if you're a 20-something you don't know you you only knew them as successes and why even go do that why not take them at face value yep so who are we talking about here yeah I think there's three examples that we could think of that are folks that we that we some of them we know decently well um so Sam Altman is one our colleague of many years another one is Elon Musk I think people have heard of him pretty famous guy yeah and then of course Peter Thiel and so those those are the examples that we're that we're going to come first to talk about today and I think that you know as a note here what I'm trying to say that everything that they say is not true like yeah really good advice and they're also pretty damn good people to have as Heroes considering what they've accomplished but if you're actually looking for the how I get to where they got there might be some yeah some tricks and so I guess to start with the example that folks have been asking us about a lot is is with Sam yes and so again we you know for everyone's context Sam was our colleague for like seven years a long time we worked with them every day so we know we know Sam very well I think I first met him 15 years ago yeah you're right I met him post seven away anyway we've known him a long time yes and he recently made some comments about hey I don't know about some of the advice I gave when I was working at YC like you know maybe there's just a better way to do startups of like going really big and being ambitious and yes you know fair enough so a lot of folks a lot of money raise a lot of money hire team yeah build a lab that takes years you know super cool I think it's worked well for him yes and so a lot of people are asking about us and you know I think he makes Fair points um but we should talk story is important which we'll get to in a minute yes so maybe the next one is Elon you know some version of oh it's been more exciting to work in the world of of atoms or yrp yeah people aren't doing articious enough startups Founders need to be fixing the world seeing the world going to space which by the way I don't disagree with that that's cool I would like Founders to do that but that's not once again that might not have been his history on the news and we'll go into that and the last one of course um his teal he's giving a lot of advice but a lot of things which is great the one that we are flagging here is the whole don't go to college college is  yeah um type of thing which again all right that's there's some Fair points to make there yes but not his path yes so let's actually go through the kind of the histories here so you know if we start with Sam Sam's first startup wasn't open AI um it was a company named loot um he did it when he um left Stanford yeah he was a college job out he went to Stanford and then he went to YC and then um he was able to raise money for looped and looped was like a mobile social product to see where your friends were in the city at least before on the iPhone and you know raise a relatively small amount of money had a relatively small team iterated and honestly like used the YC Network and then the network he built on top of the YC Network to build a successful career yeah interestingly enough like that worked really well for him yeah and people don't think about looped we don't talk about looped I don't even know probably people seen this video you know Google this is a real thing there's a lot there's lots out there but this was a really important part of how someone like this was created or how they how they got enough of a network to make change in the world was doing what was a pretty Garden variety path similar to your nice path and many of our colleagues path and just doing a pretty normal startup at a pretty normal age with a pretty normal outcome like pretty standard yeah and it's weird right like go to a good school do YC start a startup that is what led to eventually open AI you know right and so we're just flagging this so people remember it doesn't happen is that the beginning States before open AI was was fairly standard stuff and so if you actually wanted to emulate Sam you would not immediately go try to start a lab and raise 100 million dollars or whatever yeah um because that's not at all what he did and by the way nor could you I guess like a really important point for like literally 99.9999 of Founders you couldn't copy Sam's Place starting at open AI Sam couldn't copy Sam's play starting at open AI and by the way and I think this is an important point to make like I sometimes do meet people who who can do things better or have inherent advantages and the advice I give them is very different yeah you know and so you know if you can do this maybe you're great consider it yeah but if you can't why are we debating whether it's the right move or not it's just yeah a lot of the people that were most influenced by his advice of like maybe I should be raising 100 million are people that are not going to raise 100 no so why so it's kind of like a disservice to these people yeah right and so if you're one of the people out there that can raise them to a startup because they're like if I can't raise 100 million dollars why even bother yes like that's not that's not real all right so the next one is Elon you're familiar with yourself yeah so um I actually heard the story from Elon verbatim I met him before and so I'll tell you what he told me about his life story and again perhaps he is an unreliable narrator about his own life certainly possible based on my interactions with them but what he told me is the reason he started um what was it called zip2 and PayPal was he wanted to make a lot of money he said what I wanted to do with my life is go to space and I knew to go to space I needed a lot of money um the actual line he told me I swear this is a direct quote is he said my plan is to die on Mars hopefully not on impact and I can tell he uses that line a lot it's a laugh line I think you said this in those interviews but that's the line you told me yes and he was like look when I came to the US I came to Silicon Valley it was a.com boom and I just knew I needed money and so I just was like how can I get money fast Yes again this is very honest the way he told us to me um and that's why he did Tech startups and like all the ideas that he came up with were just about trying to build the most successful company using I don't know the conventional stuff yeah like his ideas were pretty conventional it wasn't hard tech it wasn't deep Tech it was it was I need 100 million dollars to start it was yeah I mean he did raise a lot of money for for x.com but basically it was pretty standard startup stuff yeah and then he leveraged his success at these companies yes and the network that he got and the money that he made to start SpaceX which is super cool way to go yeah and then became an investor in Tesla and many times if you know the history of Tesla he had to personally dip into his own checking account and bail the company out yeah and if he were not an extremely wealthy person there's no way Tesla could have existed no and so it's very hard for us to have this knowledge and for me to have this knowledge of of talking to Elon and see people trying to emulate in-state Elon yeah like they're trying to live their life uh as per elon's words when it's like man Elon didn't live his life to elon's words but I'll say this I think what's interesting is it's impressive to have this two-step plan and do it I might even argue that what Elon did was more impressive I agree right like start two businesses sell two businesses be rich enough to like start self-driving car company rocket League like hell if you've got the balls to do that yeah that's a great plan yeah but again the key thing is to realize you have to do step one most most mere mortals out in the world need to do step one yes and can't skip to step two even though step two sounds cooler yes mere mortals including Elon including literally Elon himself was a mere mortal it was a mere by this definition um so number three yeah is pure teal and probably one of the things that most young people know about him the most is um his critique on on College and like do you need to go to college and I think said um totally fair critique totally valid critique yes but she went to college and not only like did he go to college he went to college he went to law school he did undergrad law firm and he got law degree from Stanford yeah he worked at a famous law firm and a famous bank and like one might argue he's basically telling you to avoid all that stuff that stuff brought him pain but I think one of the things I've learned in advising startups is that um if you don't let the startup experience any pain it's a lot harder for them to learn yeah and like maybe experiencing that pain is what broke them into this yeah and we don't have an A B test again maybe you could probably hate that we're saying this but like if we had an A B test and he was exactly the person he was Now by just omitting College completely then fair enough he wins the argument yeah but my sense is there was some aspect of those experiences that had a profound impact on on his later success well even if we separate out cycle analyzing you should know that he didn't walk that path that's true and then use those facts as you will so why why do people give startups advice that they didn't take I think you should always assume positive intent in people that's I mean I really try to do and especially these three people yeah these are great they're trying to they're trying to help people yes and so I think this is well-meaning and I think what's going on is they're so used to their backstory they almost become blind to it just like we can any human can become can forget their backstory yes and what they're really focusing on is what they would do now based on the information they have now yes well I I want to say that more specifically I almost think a lot of this advice is advice that they wish they could go back in time and tell themselves yep right like I think Sam is one of the best fundraisers ever I wonder if he had tried to raise more money sooner his career to do a bigger thing if there was a moment we could have gotten that done before open AI probably probably right um ditto yeah he was working on nuclear energy stuff for a while 2013. and he was at YC for a while he didn't he probably could have left YC earlier right ditto for for teal and by the way like I find myself doing this like I find myself giving advice sometimes where I'm like oh well I definitely went through that and I want to help people avoid what we did exactly and so I think it's all good intent but I think that what's tricky is that if you're not digging for the facts you don't know what really happened yep so how do we avoid this NYC because you know yeah also startups we have our own scars exactly we are self-aware and we we actually try someone can make a video about us about the same topic right and and so one of the things that we try to do with companies in the batch at the beginning of the batch is we all tell our own stories about us our whole backstory what we did before we started our companies everything we screwed up everything we screwed up I think the government had to banic who were ruining their internet Justin says I will give you fifty thousand dollars we're really honest and I actually think it helps people get to know us to contextualize us as humans yeah um to know our whole story and I yeah I think it really helps to know how many mistakes you can make and still do something interesting yeah and so I think it's good to actually hear before you um cherry pick bits and pieces of people's advice let's go to kind of like a fuller yeah yes perspective on their whole thing yes I think it's helpful yes and even even us like I think if people knew more about us they were watching these videos yeah they probably would add some Nuance to what we say in these in these videos 100 right at 100 um I think the second thing is and you made this point I think we think a lot about what would we tell people we were really close to what would we tell our kids what would we tell our friends kids like when it become like when you can personalize it and make it real in your life suddenly you're a little bit more maybe conservative or you're a little bit more real yeah and you can be a little bit more experimental you know you don't like kids go to school and like I didn't really like college and I actually wasn't terribly impressed with my school I went to Yale I wasn't terribly impressed but if you look at the facts it's where I met my co-founders without them I wouldn't be here right now so if that's the only thing y'all did for me it changed your life yeah the only thing it did for me was changing my life yeah well you know what have you done for me lately but yeah imagine we had an A B test where you didn't go to college hey man I don't think no I would not be here absolutely not yeah so I'm probably gonna tell them to go to college risk it yeah and again I feel I feel the same way I got kids too and I actually really try to give them I try to give Founders or the people in these videos I try to say the same stuff I would just say to my kids yes like and not have a oh let's throw in a troll opinion here Michael just for for the hell of it like well it's funny because PG always said this too which is just like it's just easier to tell the truth like what you really think than to think up the like yeah because you got to keep all the facts straight yeah it's really hard right but like if I tell this to my kids probably it's good for you too and I think the last one and this is one that is maybe hard for people to understand is that you know when you're watching videos or reading a Content this is we can't personalize it for you right like you're we're making this from yeah we're just talking to the void we don't know who's actually watching this but we do office hours with companies everything is personal we read their application we interviewed them we accepted them to YC yes and so the advice we give is super personalized yes and it's often the case that we will know something about someone's background yes that we can integrate into yes the advice that we give them and and I'll say that like more explicitly we often contradict or or it looks like we're contradicting kind of standard YC advice given someone's specific situation now I'd say like on average we're probably telling them 80 of the same stuff and so an example if someone was a multi-time Founder yeah like say sam and someone was known to be a good investor and we had the opinion that they were a good investor yeah maybe following the Playbook that he's following it open AI is exactly right and I completely think it's smart he should do that well we've had those people do I see and we've given them different advice and we have said it may make sense to raise more money and like that and yeah if you can put millions of your own money into your own company oh you should totally do that yeah that doesn't apply to most people yes and so I think this is what's important I think one of the ways that we try to kind of control ourselves is figure out what the personal advantages are of every funnel we work with and try to figure out how to help them exploit their advantages I think it's really really hard to do that in general yeah so um shout out to of course Sam and Elon and Peter they've made a huge impact and you know and are better fundraisers than us by a thousand they're really good yes um but if you want to be the next one of them take some time to learn about them and and their histories and I think it'd be really helpful all right great sponge thank you
