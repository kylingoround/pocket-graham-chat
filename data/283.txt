foreign [Music] I'm Hodge tiger one of the group Partners at y  combinator today I'm going to talk about whether   you should start a startup because YC invests  in startups so early I've spent a lot of time   with people who aren't yet sure if they should  start a company or not I've helped many people   including my own friends and family think about  this decision at my intended audience for this   talk is anyone who doesn't feel ready to start  a startup today but thinks they may want to one   day in the future I'm going to break down the  topic of whether you should start a startup into   two parts first we'll talk about which types of  people seem best suited to being startup Founders   and help you figure out if you might be one of  them second we'll talk about how you might best   prepare yourself for becoming a startup founder  in the future let's start by helping you figure   out if you're the kind of person who should become  a startup founder or not I really wish there were   simple test you could take that would give you a  clear and correct answer to that question I've now   worked with almost a thousand startup Founders as  a group partner at YC and I still get surprised by   which people take to Startup life like a duck  to water and which ones struggle to adapt now   you might find this surprising if your image of  startups is based on the way famous Founders are   often depicted in books or movies these depictions  can make it seem that if you're not a ruthless   brilliant programmer like Mark Zuckerberg in The  Social Network movie or a charismatic product   genius like Steve Jobs in one of the many books or  movies about him you probably aren't cut out to be   a startup founder now I can't deny it that being  a brilliant programmer or a charismatic product   genius will certainly make it easier to be a  successful startup founder but I can say that   after working with many successful Founders  there are many more different types of people   who succeed as startups with different strengths  than just those stereotypes as an investor my job   is to pick which people will make great startup  Founders and yet even after 15 years of starting   and investing in startups I still get surprised  by who turns out to be a great startup founder   that means it's going to be hard for you to know  for sure if you're suited to being one you might   think you could just look at how well someone has  done in school or at work and assume success there   will lead to success of startups that's definitely  what I thought when I first started working at YC   in 2010 and began reading YC funding applications  for the first time after I started working with   more startups though I realized that these signals  mattered much less than I'd expected they would   when you're working on a startup you have to  put in Blood Sweat and Tears to convince even a   single user to care about trying your product let  alone convincing the first 10 or 100 you have to   push through a lot of rejection to get there and  because this is your startup all of that rejection   feels very personal in a way it doesn't when  you're working at a Fan Company building a product   for someone else it takes a lot of resilience  to make it through this initial struggle to get   your early users and that's the quality I think  is most important for startup Founders to have   resilient people are suited to startups and should  definitely become Founders but how do you know if   you have enough resilience to be a startup founder  when I first started working at yce I thought I   could use confidence as a proxy for resilience I'd  assume that if someone projected confidence like   speaking with conviction being high energy during  our funding interviews they were likely to be a   resilient founder the more Founders I worked with  though the more I realized this was also wrong   it turned out that someone could appear very  confident initially but not be resilient when   their startup hit roadblocks conversely some of  the quietest and least confident seeming Founders   at first turned out to be the most resilient  Founders I'd go on to work with many eventually   taking their companies public this is Saji the  founder of benchlink I met him when we funded   benjling in 2012. benjling is now worth over  six billion dollars and Sagi has grown into   a formidable founder and CEO but I remember when  we first interviewed him and his co-founder Corey   they were both softly spoken engineers and we  were all concerned they wouldn't be suited to   working on benchling because benchling's idea  was to sell software to biotech companies and   pharmaceutical companies to make money and we  weren't sure that they would be good at that   kind of Enterprise sales this concern was  shared by investors at demoday who worried   that they wouldn't be able to get those biotech or  pharmaceutical companies to pay for the benchling   software and benjling struggled to raise very  much seed funding at demoday sales did turn out   to be a real struggle for benchlink in fact over a  year after they'd graduated from YC benchling was   still not making any Revenue though they did  have some enthusiastic grad students as free   users and the product continued getting better  it took them almost another year that's now two   years after ycee to start doing sales and making  any Revenue now benchling is on calls to become   a public company someday and has many of the  world's top biotech and pharmaceutical companies   as customers looking back I always had confidence  that Sagi was a good engineer but I could not have   predicted back when we funded him in 2012 that he  would have the resilience to overcome that amount   of rejection and transform himself into the leader  of a company that took many years to become great   at Enterprise sales but what I haven't shared  with you are the stories of many other Founders   who seemed equally talented at first when we  first funded their companies but turned out   not to have the same amount of resilience as these  Founders did I've thought a lot about how to tell   the difference between people who have this kind  of startup resilience and those who don't I've   wondered if maybe having the right motivations or  reasons to start a company mean you're more likely   to have this special resilience over time though  I've decided that this also doesn't matter as much   as I had thought I think there are many perfectly  legitimate motivations to start a company for   example it's become popular to say that you  shouldn't start a company just to make money   that's considered a somewhat flimsy motivation but  I actually think it's fine to start a startup to   become rich startups are one of the few ways  to make life-changing amounts of money in a   relatively short period of time if the desire to  make money gets you started then great go for it   I also think that simply being curious about  what it's like to found a startup is a fine   initial motivation to start one actually doing  a startup is the only way to know for sure if   you'll enjoy it the reason I have conviction  that your initial motivations don't matter so   much is that I've seen motivation to change over  time I've seen Founders who started out a company   with a plan to sell it within a year change  their mind as they kept working the company   and they're still working on that same startup  a decade later and it's now a public company   this means that your initial motivations to  start a startup aren't as important as what   those motivations might change into over time in  order to keep working on a startup and keep going   through those dark periods that every startup  experience is you need enduring motivations   and I think the best ones are to be genuinely  interested in the problem you're working on and   love the people you're working with we'll talk  more about finding those later so instead of   introspecting too much on if you'll make a good  startup founder I'll offer some practical advice   if you are curious about what it'd be like to  start a company start by asking yourself what   do I have to lose now I mean this question not  as a rhetorical one but as a very practical one   figure out what the worst case scenario looks  like if you started a startup and decide if   you can live with that it's probably going to  take at least a year for you to have enough   data to tell if the startup you're working  on is promising enough to keep working on   in the worst case you'll shut down the company  without having earned much or any salary for   that year can you live without worst case  the calculus here is different for everyone   if you're about to graduate college taking a year  after graduating to work on a startup is not a big   deal those job offers will still be waiting for  you in a year but if you've been a Fang employee   for the past nine years and you're in line for a  big promotion this year then maybe you stand to   lose a lot by spending the next year working on a  startup instead asking yourself if you can handle   the worst case is the best way to know if you  should start a startup be honest with yourself if   you can't actually handle the worst case then your  own constant anxiety will probably self-sabotage   your startup efforts when you're thinking about  the worst case scenario of working on a startup   you should Factor something else into the equation  you will learn a lot from starting a company I   don't think enough people factor in how valuable  this learning is when they're doing their worst   case scenario analysis as a startup founder you're  responsible for making everything happen and that   means you get to do lots of different types  of work you'll have to do some amount of sales   product and customer support all at once this can  be very clarifying in helping you figure out what   type of work you enjoy and where you might want to  focus your career even if the startup doesn't work   out some people start a company that doesn't work  and then they jump straight back into starting   another one because they want to learn from their  mistakes others decide they actually really enjoy   specializing in doing one thing really well and  they join a company where they can do just that   the startup experience can really improve your  career opportunities even if the startup doesn't   succeed my second startup triple bite use software  to help companies identify and hire great people   I work with hundreds of employers as they search  for the best talent and I found that many of them   were explicitly looking to hire people who  had previous startup experience they believe   they showed evidence of being a self-starter and  being able to take initiative and Lead projects   some of the most successful YC companies have  actually built their hiring processes around this   knowledge Rippling a 10 billion dollar company  founded by Parker Conrad also a YC company hires   former Founders and puts them in charge of entire  product divisions usually we love hiring former   Founders to run specific product lines and and  build them and and really run them as general   managers we've been you know really successful at  recruiting I think we have Lao now probably around   50 former Founders that work at rip Lane at YC  we often see startup Founders leave this thought   up if it doesn't work out and go on to join a  more successful YC company this is Nick Grandy   YC funded his first startup wonderbar in 2008.  that startup shut down but he went on to join   another YC company you may have heard of Airbnb  as his first employee that of course worked out   great and after many years at Airbnb he left  to start another YC company out school which   is now valued at over 3 billion I share these  stories to show how career progressions are   not always perfectly linear introducing some  Serendipity and meeting smart ambitious people   can completely transform your career and being  a startup founder is a great way to do exactly   that okay so let's say you do decide you can  live with the worst case of doing a startup but   you're not ready to do one right now how can you  best prepare yourself to start one in the future   to actually start a company you'll want two things  an idea and a co-founder now sometimes an idea and   co-founder both come to you quickly and you're Off  to the Races there's lots of great startup content   out there about how to start a company once you're  ready but let's talk about what to do if it will   take you some time to get to that point I'd start  by encouraging you to not think of finding ideas   and co-founders as two separate tasks it's hard  to think up good ideas yourself also your ideas   will start out being vague and fuzzy more like  a hunch or an Impulse than a clearly formed idea   and you'll go through seven iterations of fleshing  it out into something more tangible and concrete   having someone to talk through that initial  idea or impulse with and debate and discuss   is important and the best person to do that with  is your co-founder I find my best ideas come to   me during conversations with smart people so I'd  start by thinking about who do you know that you   enjoy talking about ideas with in college these  are often the people you'll go to when you're   stuck on a hard problem or they are the people  you most enjoy working on group assignments with   at work these are the colleagues who you find  make you the most productive and help you do   your best work I'd see these people out and start  having conversations with them about ideas or   technologies that you find interesting talk about  products you use every day that you admire or are   frustrated by talk about Technologies  you think are underrated today and why   flesh your thoughts out and debate them spend  the time between these conversations doing your   own reading and research to learn more about the  topics you find interesting if you're a curious   person this will seem natural to you anyway all  of this primes your mind to more easily notice   and think of potential startup ideas and it helps  you get to know your friends or colleagues better   as potential co-founders if you're struggling to  think of people you enjoy talking about ideas with   then you probably need to change your environment  and meet some new people if you really want to   start a company one day it's best to choose an  environment where you will be around many people   who might someday be your co-founder I think the  best environment for this is working at a startup   you both get to see how a startup works from  the inside and your colleagues will be less   risk-averse than the average Fang employee so  if you're in college I'd recommend finding a   startup to work at after graduation or if you had  a fan company now think about leaving to join a   startup as an intermediate step to starting your  own someday once you're around smart people who   you enjoy talking about ideas with I'd recommend  you start experimenting with turning these ideas   into side projects at some point during these  conversations you'll eventually say something   like huh like it'd be cool if someone built X and  that's the moment to stop and think about how you   could be the one to build X is there a simple  first version you could build over a weekend or   can you find other people who might be users and  Pitch them on the idea to see how they react keep   pulling on this thread until you've come up with a  plan to turn this idea into something real however   small it is right now you're not trying to launch  the next unicorn you're just getting used to the   experience of turning ideas into reality and  experiencing the thrill of launching something   turn your idea into something real you'll  need the skills to actually build them   if you're not a programmer then either you need  to learn how to program or find a co-founder who   is a programmer my advice speaking from experience  is someone who started his first startup without   being able to code you start learning to code you  only need to learn enough to build a version one   of your ideas once you're around smart people  and you're working on some side projects   how do you know when it's time to take the leap  and quit your job to start a company while it'd   be great if one of your side projects started  getting explosive traction and made the decision   easy for you you can't rely on that happening if  you're serious about starting a company someday   even if you launch your side projects and get some  early users the feedback you get will be mixed   it's not uncommon for the early use of any product  to span the spectrum of being delighted appalled   and indifferent towards a product to judge how  promising your side project is as a startup idea   I'd use some advice from my y combinator partner  Paul bukhai he says that it is better to make a   product that a few people really love than one a  lot of people are indifferent Awards if your side   project elicits a deep reaction from someone the  kind where they can legitimately say that doing   something very differently as a result of your  product existing then you may be onto something a   single passionate user of a crude prototype that  was hacked together in a weekend means so much   more than a million sign-ups on a waitlist for  something that doesn't exist yet my main advice to   you would be to think less about how well your  side projects are going and think more about   how much you enjoying the process of thinking up  ideas and turning them into something real are you   learning new things and finding yourself energized  contrast this feeling with your day job if you   find your job is draining but you have energy  to work on your side projects on evenings and   weekends that's a sign it may be time to quit and  work on your own ideas pay particular attention to   how much you enjoy working with your side project  collaborators if you enjoy working with them and   you both want to be startup Founders recognize how  rare that is having a great co-founder who wants   to do a startup is a fantastic reason to quit and  start one to finish my advice is one don't worry   too much about your initial motivations or reasons  to start a company those can change over time   simply being curious about the experience  of starting a startup is enough to get going   think about the worst case scenario if you did  start a company and be sure you can live with that   if you don't yet have an idea or co-founder start  looking around for smart people to talk about   ideas with and launch some side projects  with actually launch those side projects   however small to get the experience of turning  ideas into reality and if you find someone you   really enjoy working with side projects with and  you both want to start a company make the jump   I really hope you do and I hope we get to work  together at YC Community someday thanks so much [Music]
