let's say that changing the world is like uprooting a tree like a big old tall tree imagine there were two founders one founder knew that trees have roots and the other founder had no idea right like the trees with roots person they have an advantage they have a very large advantage the tree without roots person they're gonna have a lot of very horrible uh how do i freeze this on the job learning so yeah it's not moving like we don't get it like like we we we're pushing it in it won't fall over yeah we've done all the math like if the tree ends right where the ground begins like pushing like this it should it should work hey this is michael cybel with dalton caldwell and welcome to rookie mistakes we asked yc founders for their rookie mistakes so we could share them with you and help you avoid them here's the next comment that was written by oyc founder we built a product because we thought the world should be a certain way not because we had a customer who actually wanted to buy the thing we were building this is coming from a pure place and we look at our heroes right we look at elon musk we look at steve jobs and we have this model of people that forced the universe to their will and and elon electric cars of the future i am going to impart electric cars i'm going to make it happen and and again he kind of did good for him right but for most of us mere mortals it's pretty hard to force people to want the thing that you're selling or the thing that you think is good for them it's really hard if someone doesn't want something to like debate them and convince them they do actually want it when they don't actually want it most people don't have organic experience with sales and so they kind of their vision is like oh i walked onto a used car lot to look around and this genius salesforce person convinced me to buy this car and it's like that's not even how it works in real life you didn't just randomly walk on the used car nobody who doesn't want to touch that you made a great point do you know what you know what kind of idea we always come like i would come up with is guess what buying a car sucks and dealing with car salesman sucks buying a house sucks let's just like build a website and we'll get rid of car dealers so this is an example of that it's like you kind of run into something that's annoying and you you're like yeah let's just get rid of that and again i'm with you let's get rid of that you know i don't like buying a car either but i think what happens when you again haven't done the research yeah is you were like oh actually there's a reason car dealers exist and oh and actually there's incentives for these you know this is like like the more you dig into that you you realize that you can't just wave a magic wand and make car dealers go away you can't just sprinkle software on the property yeah or like realtors like buying a house why is it so hard to buy a house well you know yeah i don't even know how to summarize that but like like a lot of founders want to believe they can just like start a company and revolutionize the home sales process right so i feel where it's coming from but in practice the simplistic engineering efficiency arguments don't always work when applied to the real world yeah i mean you know about this from hiring right like haven't you seen this with hiring i see this all the time i see the hiring startup applies to yc and the thesis is always the same i'm an engineer i'm a genius engineer and i'm being assessed by a non-technical recruiter this is a crime like this is a crime against humanity like it's it's um dehumanizing that i have to go through this experience and if only the hiring manager was empowered with software the entire recruiting team and all recruiters would just go away disappear off the face of the earth through the hiring manager and software and what's weird is that like i kind of believe the premise like i believe an engineer is better at determining whether another engineer is good or bad however i also look at the way the world is organized and i ask myself well if it seems consistently organized that these massive teams of recruiters exist at all these companies there must be some efficiency going on that i don't understand right and the one core thing that i've learned is that even though engineers are better at creating other engineers there are two other facts one they don't tend to enjoy doing it and two it doesn't tend to be the greatest way to extract value out of a great engineer yeah it's not the best use of their time like if you're employing engineers you don't really want them to spend all their time doing this you want them to be doing their jobs and so what's funny is that like hiring companies inevitably run against this like you aren't going to defeat hr you aren't going to get rid of all the recruiters even though you don't believe they should exist in the world they are going to exist in the world either you're going to accommodate them or they will kill you like they tend to actually have way more power than you might think in the end of the day the hiring manager is like you know this comes up a lot like the the hiring manager is your like talk friend but not your action friend like it's the person you talk to is like oh yeah i wish i never had to use these recruiters like i wish i'd have to do this i always get all these bad candidates but they never do the thing you want them to do like use your product all the time to push back on ourselves hey what are dalton and michael saying they're not saying you should try to change things like shouldn't aren't we you know shouldn't you be trying harder to make the system better let me let me let me answer that first i don't know what you say michael all we're saying is you can make huge changes in human behavior if you really understand the subtle pressure points you've got to really understand the motivations of all of the key parties and cater to those motivations cater to human institutions like like the people that do really change the way the world works got a lot of small things right in the earliest stages like ride sharing like the idea of getting to a stranger's car and then driving to the airport was like bizarre when it came out our younger our younger viewers may not remember what it was like but at the time it was like yeah here's my idea a stranger comes to your house and you get in the back seat of the toyota right that's normal we would have that was insane and so to actually architect something like ride sharing you had to really understand all of the people involved they actually started off with those hired cars those like limo cars which was normal yeah so there's all these like little things that had to happen for that idea to actually work and to normalize ride sharing that if you didn't understand all the core constituents and you're just like hey cars are inefficient we should have more we should let people share rides how many times has yc funded that idea before uber and it didn't work this was actually a really common bad startup idea was ride sharing isn't that hilarious yeah and so it's i guess the point we're making here and again i wanna hear what you think of this michael you just need to understand the little things folks you need to understand the small motivations of all people involved in an ecosystem and and design the thing well rather than just thinking you can burst in this burst down to the scene with something and like everyone will magically use your solution and boom you know hey there's no more realtors we can just buy and sell a house on a website like it's more complicated than that man you have to have a really someone will solve this eventually maybe someone watching this video but you have to really look at the intricate motivations of every person involved and have an answer for why they're incentivized to use your thing you know i'm gonna try to come up with the bad analogy on the spot let's say that changing the world is like uprooting a tree like a big old tall tree imagine there were two founders one founder knew that trees have roots and the other founder had no idea right like the trees with roots person they have an advantage they have a very large advantage the tree without roots person they're gonna have a lot of very horrible uh how do i freeze this on the job learning so yeah i mean it's not moving like we don't get it like like we we we're pushing it down it won't fall over yeah we've done all the math like if the tree ends right where the ground begins like pushing like this it should it should work that's a great way to say it there's so much under the surface there's so much on the surface to understand with a lot of these ideas and if you don't understand it you're yeah you're gonna learn like like you'll get some much on the job training that's a great way to say it yes here was the next um comment that was written in yc founder wrote we did not do enough research before deciding what to work on we now realize the more research you do in your space before you write a line of code the better it seems like people go to the effort of starting a company of trying to raise money for a company of applying to yc with a company of making it to yc interviews with a company and we can tell you haven't googled it you haven't typed in like the idea that you're working on into google or read any articles about folks that have tried it before and this is such a self-own um it's free to do research on those that came before you and failed cost you nothing doesn't take very much time and to spend years of your life or months of your life or any amount of your life on an idea that you've not done just basic cursory research on is really dumb do you understand like maybe you'll do it better or different but to not even understand what came before you is kind of a willful ignorance and i don't get that right it's almost like do you think michael do you think it's that they don't want to know or that they just don't think it applies to them or oh this time it's different like why would you obstinately refuse to research related companies in the past i would say one this is very commonly a young founder um issue and one thing i see about young founders is their like internet knowledge doesn't go way back so like i think the first mistake is like well if i haven't heard of a company trying to do this that means the company has never tried to do it um i think the second thing that people do is they ask their friends here this is a situation where like googling is probably a hundred times better than asking your friends because like if you're a young person whose internet history is like four years old your friends are probably in the similar position um and then i think the last thing is a bit of a psychological thing i think that's what you're getting to which is if i'm so excited to do this why would i want to learn something that would like defeat it before it started yeah you know like can i live in the illusion in the dream for a little longer and again let's let me be direct on this one during the dot-com bubble in the 90s a lot of people started companies and a lot of them tried pretty much every idea you can imagine right every idea that you see today has some analog from the 90s so dig in look into it like see if people have tried this before right same deal in the 2000s people pretty much tried every idea and again maybe in the example of something like instacart people had tried instacart before it didn't work but the founders of instacart knew that and they intentionally designed it to be better you understand what i'm saying like like they stood on the shoulders of those that came before them smart versus if you're the founder of instacart and you didn't realize that webvan existed how is that hope like you're not helping yourself to not know about it same in the 2010s think about how many startups we funded their tricep before and so from our perspective we see patterns and the ideas people start constantly and we get it you know you're better smarter faster you have a better programming language or you know whatever it is you're better you know we better ui dalton i got better ui you know oh mobile i remember in our in our era when we were young founders it was like oh we're an app we're an iphone app iphone changes everything which is built true but doesn't mean we should have discounted history you know dalton as you were saying this something occurred to me the platforms change faster than the human problems so like you and i have lived through one web 100 web 2o mobile and whatever the hell yeah platform yeah we've seen many of these but it turns out that like i want to go grocery shopping but i don't want to go to the grocery store that's been a problem the whole time like or i want to get good food delivered to me in where i am so i don't have to go get it same human problem the whole i want to get a job same problem and i think that's maybe the logical reason why you should do the research because it's almost guaranteed you're not solving a new problem you're just using a slightly new technique or a new technology or something new to try to attack an old problem let's study how everyone else tried to attack the old problem and it's weird because you know sometimes rarely but sometimes you're doing something on the internet that hasn't been put on the internet for um that hasn't been done internet before you know with justin tv live video hadn't really been done on the internet before what was interesting was almost inadvertently we got to learn about the old way because we started getting a lot of press coverage and we started getting a lot of these um old-fashioned video guys doing live video news coverage of us and we would see them with their like van would pull up and it's like we beam this from the camera to the van to the microwave thing on that hill over there it's gotta all line up and we're like oh  like and that was like state of the art and so to me it's like wow watching that we were like well you know our thing isn't as good as theirs but it's way easier than having a van and a microwave dish up on a hill so nellie plays devil's advocate a little bit dalton i have an expert advisor i have an angel investor i have a seed investor i've got a series a investor they're the experienced ones and they believe they're working with me like isn't that validation enough don't they didn't they do this research kind of i mean let's go to this two ways one it's best to do your own work on this um because ultimately you're responsible for your company and it working or not and this is what i tell people in the batch you know i'm like well just make sure you know you have to live you have to live your life so if your star doesn't work it's not really my problem you know like like i'll i'll be okay and so feel like you've done all of the diligence and research and you know the risks of what you're doing but you know to the extent i have relevant advice it could be helpful i think the other thing is sometimes experts can be too biased positively or negatively based on a small data set so if you're working on a startup idea that someone had either personally worked on before or lost lots of money invested in before they're going to have opinions in my case you know media and entertainment startups are really hard so i you know i know a lot about them i can advise people on them but i'm not usually the most optimistic on that startup idea um and then and so when you're talking to experts just make sure you get a wide variety of them i think would be my my reaction to your pushback and synthesize them just in the same way i said earlier it's good to listen to lots of different kinds of music to synthesize together i would just be synthesizing a lot of different opinions or a lot of different pieces of history as you're forming an opinion you know in the in the brex example they went and spoke to every person that ever tried to start a challenger bank before and guess what they all told them they told them two things one useful information that they wrote down in their notes the founders of did and two they told him don't do this are you crazy so they had the breakfast ignored that part but this is similar when you speak to experts you just need to know what bits and pieces to draw from what they have to say than to blindly accept what they say as facts and that includes us totally right you know i think you bought up something so counterintuitive about investors like i get so many emails from people saying like i'm doing social this or live video that can you help me and like i'm one of those people who's like wow i've i took a lot of hits during my social media live video days like i i think sometimes counterintuitively investors who know slightly less about your space can be a little bit more grasses greener like optimistic than folks who know more about your space and i think that's not something that i realized i don't think something that's obvious to founders i think that like people assume expertise equals optimism yeah right haven't we observed the opposite of that yeah i mean yeah there's something nice about not knowing much about something it's much easier to see it is a simple question or a simple problem like imagine asking the founders of doordash about food delivery and what they would have to say about it versus me versus yeah exactly yes
