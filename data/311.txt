[Music] hi i'm han stagger and i'm partner at white community and today i'm going to be talking about what i think are to be the most important part of starting a company which is finding the right co-founder so let's start by talking about why should you have a co-founder at all well i think there's three main reasons you really want a co-founder when you're starting a company the first is productivity you can get a lot more work done if you have someone to divide the work up with and you can get much better work done if you have a co-founder who maybe has complementary skills so they can do things that you can't and there's someone you enjoy discussing ideas with so you can brainstorm and come up with better ideas and you could alone or help have someone to talk you out of potentially bad ideas so you get a lot of uplift in just the amount and quality of work you can do with a co-founder the second reason is moral support startups are an incredibly intense and taxing journey and it's great to have someone you can lean on for support during the tough times and what i've noticed about the best co-founder relationships is they have this dynamic where both co-founders kind of balance each other out so if one founder is having a bad day they're feeling a little down despondent and they've become a little pessimistic and feel like the startup's about to die the other co-founder can just help bring them up a little bit um and keep them going keep them motivated and vice versa sometimes you get too carried away you signed a customer and you think you're guaranteed to ipo and you could use someone to just ground you and bring it back to uh reality a little bit and so that's where i kind of find the best co-founding relationships can help kind of even out some of the highs and lows of the emotional rollercoaster that is a startup and while you can get sort of productivity increased by hiring people or bringing on contractors you don't get that same emotional support that you do from a co-founder because ultimately anyone who's working for you you're the boss and they're not as invested in the success of the startup as you are and you can't really be as open or honest with them about the company as you can be with a peer and that's what you get from a co-founder the final reason i'd say to have a co-founder is pattern matching to success if you look at a list of the most successful startups in history think of apple facebook google microsoft they all had co-founders when they started and now i think sometimes people forget this point because when you think of these great iconic companies you associate them with a single person usually the ceo who's over time risen to become prominent and famous and a bit of a celebrity so you know when you think of apple you think of steve jobs when you think of microsoft bill gates and we think of facebook mark zuckerberg right i think it's completely true that over time and we're talking at this point decades because that's how long uh successful startups are around for uh over that time period it's pretty common for one person to kind of really drive the company become the figurehead for it and stick out a company for a long period of time and that's why i remember those people but we're talking about the earliest stages of starting a company and in those days all of these founders had co-founders that they lent on for all the reasons i just mentioned so i think it's always important to remember that when you're starting a company and wondering whether you should have a co-founder or not okay so hopefully i've convinced you that you really do want a co-founder when you're starting a company but what if you're really keen to get started on a company right now and you don't have a co-founder that's immediately available or someone that you can bring on board should you wait to get a great co-founder before you start a company or should you just go ahead and get started well i think the default answer is that you should wait um because of all the reasons i just mentioned all the benefits that you get from having a co-founder but why combinator has funded single founders and we have done so successfully so i've noticed that there are some exceptions to this rule and they tend to follow a particular pattern and that pattern is that the single founder simultaneous company by themselves has two things that are true so one is they have an idea that they have incredibly high conviction about either because they're solving a personal problem for themselves so they really know solution is necessary um or they're a domain expert they're working in a field where they know for sure the sort of technology that's missing who the customers for it might be so the result of that is they have such conviction in the idea that they don't need a co-founder to convince them that this is a good idea to get started on they're they're ready to go the second condition is that those single founders they're able to make progress on that idea without a co-founder in the short term at least and that almost always means that they're technical or at least technical enough to be able to build the first version of the product so they can show it to potential investors or maybe even to potential co-founders who may want to join the company and that second point is something i've noticed that the best single founders are also able to do is not only are they tremendously productive in building product and talking to users themselves they're also able to run a great background search and keep their four co-founders and keep their eyes open and if the opportunity arises bring on a great co-founder and i think the best example i can think of here would be drew houston with dropbox so drew applied to y combinator way way back now in 2007 he had a really solid idea for building dropbox because he'd already felt the pain of losing his own files so he knew for sure there was a better solution to build but he didn't have a co-founder and so paul graham the y coordinator founder uh messaged him back saying we love your application you're great the idea is great but we really won't fund you without a co-founder so come back to us when you have one and drew kind of went away continued building uh the dropbox prototype while also looking for co-founders and found arash who would be uh later the dropbox cto and his co-founder and he applied again and wiped on me to fund him and now brock was obviously tremendous the successful company so that's kind of what i i'd ask you to bear in mind is if you're really going to stop right now but you don't have a co-founder ask yourself do you have absolute high conviction in this idea you know sure that this is the idea that you want to work on there's no other ideas and that you'd be open to and can you really make progress um without having a co-founder um and if those things are true sure go ahead and give it a give it a shot but if not i'd really suggest you wait until you do have a co-founder to start a company so when you're thinking about bringing on a co-founder what should you be looking for in them well i actually think the single most important thing to know about someone before you start a company with them is how do they handle stress so second most important is how well are they going to help you handle stress and the reason i say that is startups are incredibly stressful uh intense experience as i mentioned before and you know a great care founder should be able to support you through those and help you through those because if you're determined and motivated and enjoy working together you'll keep working on this startup for a long period of time and that's usually what it takes to build a really successful company so you really don't want to start a company with someone that you don't know particularly well because even if you've spent time with them in social events or you hung out together a little bit you don't really have insight into how they're going to respond to pressure and stress and are they someone that's going to stick around when things are tough um and are they someone that's going to help you want to stick around and things are tough so the best people to start companies with are always people that you've got some set of personal experiences where you kind of know the character and how they're going to respond to those tough situations um and that usually means there's someone like a close friend or someone that you've worked with um under sort of stressful uh conditions so i'd certainly recommend that you be on the lookout and think about that when you're considering co-founders the second thing i think you really want to look for is understanding the goals and values someone has for starting a company or wanting to do a startup and honestly i think when i was younger i used to think of some goals and values as being these like fuzzy terms i didn't mean too much but over time i realized really what they mean is understanding the motivations someone has for doing what they do and in this context i think it's really important to talk with someone even if you know them very well about why they want to do a startup what are they hoping for and the kinds of things that can come out are avoiding conflicting goals right so for example let's say that you really want to build a high growth high-intensity high-risk startup and you want to push forward you want to raise venture capital you want to hire a bunch of people you want to just really go for it and your goal is to take the company public and you're okay taking lots of risks along the way to get there that's a totally fine set of motivations it's a very common set of motivations for startup founders um but let's say your co-founder prefers to take kind of a slow and steady approach maybe they're more motivated by building great software for a small group of people and they would be totally fine if you just made enough revenue to pay yourselves good salaries and screw a little bit every year and that's also a completely fine set of motivations wanting to start a company but the two motivations there aren't compatible with each other and they'll lead to inevitable conflict so what i'd suggest is make sure that you have this conversation and it's not a perfect predictor because people's goals and ambitions for a startup change over time i've seen people start companies because honestly they just wanted to get rich and their hope was that they were able to sell the company in two to three years for a good amount to a bigger company um but they got two to three years into the company and they loved it so much they got so excited by the challenge that they kept working on it and they're still working on it a decade later so that's totally fine i'm not saying that having this conversation means you're gonna know for sure whether your goals and values are aligned over the next decade which is again how long it usually takes if a startup is successful but at least having the conversation gives you a better chance of finding a co-founder who you're aligned with around high-level important stuff now i think you're probably wondering i'm talking about what you should look for in co-founders and i haven't mentioned the obvious thing which is what skills do they have so it's obviously really important to have a co-founder who has the right sort of skills to help you grow the company and usually that means someone who's got a complimentary set of skills to you right so if you're really great at sales talking to users getting customers ideally you'd have a co-founder who's really great at building product and writing code and building software because the two of you can divide and conquer and get a lot done um why do you think that's really important i don't think it's one you should overly fixate on right so more important than anything is just working with someone that you like working with and you trust and so if sort of the person who best fits that description doesn't necessarily have the perfect set of complimentary skills to yours i think that's fine you should still bring them on as a co-founder and then you can start hiring people assuming you can make enough progress in the company to get investment you can hire people to kind of fill in the skills gaps and that's okay um another point i just make on this is when you are trying to save someone's got complimentary skills to you don't go too much into the details of how well do their skills map onto the specific idea you're working on right now so a common example of this we see sometimes is someone's considering bringing on a technical profile and they want to build a iphone app but the co-founder even though they know them they trust them they've worked with them before that co-founder isn't necessarily an iphone app developer if they haven't built iphone apps in the past um that's not a reason to rule someone out as a co-founder right what does matter is that they're willing to learn what they need to learn so if they're not an iphone developer they're willing to learn how to do that and particularly they're willing to learn things that maybe aren't glamorous like the startups are often just a grind of doing a lot of boring quad work to get the thing going and so long as you have a co-founder who's okay with that um it's totally fine if they don't have the perfect set of skill sets so don't rule someone out who's potentially a great co-founder because they don't have this checklist of specific skills you're looking for but do make sure you count them in if it's someone that you trust you like working with you've got a good sense of how they're going to handle the stress and pressure of the startup journey so where should you look for to find co-founders well the answer here is a little obvious it's to start with the people you already know so ideally your friends and colleagues and kind of ironically the best time to find a co-founder are when you're not actually necessarily looking for a co-founder to start a company with right now and what i mean by that is if i were kind of giving myself advice 10 15 years ago um what i would say is rather than sort of trying to pick a startup idea and go and find co-founders to work on with it i would suggest that i just look for people to do projects with right so if you're in school look around see who's in your class using school and like identify people that you think would be cool to work on a project with and this project doesn't have to be a take over the world ideal company just has to be something you find interesting like maybe you're into games and you want to build a cool game together um like the thing that's awesome about projects is that it's much less scarier and asking for a far lower commitment if you ask someone to work on a project with you than it is to go straight into hey let's start a company together right so you have sort of a higher chance of people saying yes if you ask them for this and the other thing that's great about projects is you can work on different projects with different people and you can start developing a taste who do you work well with what kinds of personalities like what kinds of skills are you actually good at as opposed to what you might think you're good at and so what kind of complimentary skills might you look for a co-founder and again being in school for college is a really ideal time for this because you're surrounded by lots of people who you know usually have a decent chunk of spare time and so you can start getting together to work on things that you think are fun and again kind of ironically although this is i'm suggesting you don't try and start at startup um projects that you work on in your spare time often tend to be some of the greatest sources for actually finding great startup ideas and building huge companies you know facebook's an obvious example something that started out as a project while mark zuckerberg was an undergrad at harvard and now it's turned into one of the biggest companies in the world but that's not why i'm suggesting you do this i'm suggesting you can look for people to work on projects with because that's a great way for you to get a sense of what kind of person do you enjoy working with and what specific type of personality do you work well with and this advice also applies if you're not in college or school maybe you're um if you're working at a company like look at your co-workers like keep a list of people that you think are particularly smart particularly capable who impresses you and start getting to know them better and ask them if there aren't for working on things in the evenings or weekends say that's the kind of personality that the kind of person is interested in working on evening and weekends weekend projects is the kind of person that's likely to make a great co-founder i actually remember years ago at white comedy is a startup school when it was an in-person physical event we had phil libit the founder of evernote there and he kind of gave a somewhat extreme version of this advice which was uh that he sort of years and years before we started a company knew that he wanted to start a company someday and so he would only make friends with people that he thought could someday be a co-founder and now while i think that advice is maybe a little bit extreme if you don't just want to be around people who might be co-founders there is truth to it right so i think this is kind of the thing where if you make this sort of a conscious effort well before you start the company uh it will probably be the best bet for finding a great co-founder but let's say you do know for sure that you want to start a company and you're kind of ready to go again right now like how do you start finding co-founders well again you start in the same place you start with people that you know and what i've noticed is an issue people run into here is that they can be really reluctant to just ask people they know to start a company with them and that kind of all kind of reasons there like maybe you're worried about how your relationship will change like maybe um you don't sort of value the personal relationship more than the the risks of of working with someone and those are fair concerns but it's not the right optimization for starting a company like you have to make the ask so what i'd suggest a pretty simple algorithm here for finding co-founders it's make a list of the people that you know new closest to that you think would be great co-founders and start from top to bottom and ask every single person on there to go grab coffee and talk to them and ask them if they'll start a company with you and be your co-founder and if they say no that's totally fine so you understand but like who would they start a company with and make it very specific ask them if you were starting a company who would be sort of your top three or four co-founders that you want to try and convince to work with you and ask them for an introduction to each of those people so your list keeps growing now you ask the people you know if they say no you at least get some more ideas from names and and then you meet with those people and you ask them and you simply repeat repeat the same algorithm ask them if they'd be interested in your co-founder with you or not and if they say no ask them who they try and go to and so this way you start growing the tree of potential co-founders beyond those people you immediately know but at least they're still connected by people that you do know so they're not just sort of completely random strangers the final bit of advice i'd say for where to look is go out and try and meet people that just have similar interest to you right and so this kind of sounds a little bit just like how to have a social life but um this is essentially what finding co-founders reduces to so if you're an engineer um attend like developer meetups or work on open source projects um uh or go to hackathons like do things where others engineers and builders are hanging out and you'll likely find some leaks and even if you're not technical if you're interested in those things you should totally attend those kinds of events too but maybe you also just attend or find people who are interested in the kinds of things you're interested in maybe you're interested in economics and finance and that's kind of the pool of things uh well that's a pool of interest where you think you'll find a startup idea well make a real effort to go out and meet people who have similar interests i mean at the end into these covered times there's lots of online groups and communities that you can join but even in regular times there's always ways to find people that have similar interests for you and if you're consciously on the lookout for people who might make co-founders you have a higher chance of finding someone who could be a good fit so once you've found a potential co-founder how do you test out and know for sure that you both want to start a company together before making having the final commitment well it's not a perfect process and at some point you just kind of have to make the leap and uh hope that it will work out but one way to de-risk it is to allocate a chunk of time where you agree to kind of work together and set yourself a deadline by which time you want to have ideally like a mvp or a prototype of something built or you at least want to have gone out and try it out pitching some customers and convincing them to pay you if you did build a particular product these are all the things you'd usually do when you're signing up with a new company or testing out a new idea anyhow and do that together and agree that you know at the sort of end of the time that you've set aside that you'll both have an honest conversation decide do we both enjoy working together on this um and if so great let's go ahead and make the lead and if not be honest and say hey let's go our own separate ways so making that a little bit more tangible uh if you both have you know no other commitment you know which is pretty uncommon but sometimes happens if say you both graduated college and you didn't go and get a job because you want to start a company then i'd say treat this like your full-time job right like say that hey we're going to set aside uh a month or three months and uh let's just pick a idea we're excited about and get as much progress made as we can on building the first version of it and going out and signing customers and uh even if you can't do that full time because you have other commitments then do it on evenings or weekends right but you'll have to sacrifice some amount of time doing other things in order to actually spend time working together but the more times the more hours you can accumulate of working together on the idea um the better sense you'll have for sure if you want to start a company or not right so once you've kind of done that let's say you decided that hey we do want to start the company uh and we want to be co-founders then i think there's two important points you want to make sure that you're in agreement on uh first is the equity split right like who earns how much of the company now i think the way to think about this is your default equity allocation should really be 50 50 um that's where you want to start from right because assuming that nothing's been built yet you're at the earliest stages of the company um you're both going to make equal contributions you both want to be equally motivated to work super hard on the company and all the work is years and years ahead of you so there's not really too much reason to deviate from a 50 50 x display early on however we have seen different equity arrangements and they have been successful and so i kind of think the underlying thing that you're solving for here is making sure that both of you are happy with what the equity arrangement is and will be motivated to keep working on the company for a long period of time right and so again usually that means 50 50 but let's just say that you have been working on the company for a little bit longer or you take you de-risked it somehow by yourself and you're bringing on what you commonly call a laser stage co-founder then sometimes deviating from 5015 might make sense but again the thing i would really encourage you to do is not optimize the short term right so just because you made a little bit of progress on the idea by yourself and you have a great co-founder um and you're sort of thinking hey maybe i should take seventy percent and just give them thirty percent like because you've made progress in the last six months i would encourage you not to do that startups are a really long term game and you wanna you win by making the best decision in the long term right so if you have a great potential co-founder and even though you made a little bit of progress on the company yourself if you know that they won't be all in and fully committed to the successful company unless they're a 50-50 partner you should do that and you should make them 50 equity partner so you can keep them as motivated and get as much out of them as possible the second thing i think you really want to decide is who's the ceo now this can sometimes be an uncomfortable conversation um and to be honest it's actually i think a bit of a red flag if it is an uncomfortable conversation and so as far as the actual title itself goes early on in the startup when it's just two or three co-founders in terms of how it impacts your day-to-day and how you divide up responsibilities the title doesn't actually matter like early on you're all going to be doing a little bit of everything there's like plenty of like unglamorous grunt work to go around and just because you have a ceo title doesn't mean you get too sort of abscond from that right so practically it doesn't matter like um in terms of who does what one exception to that might be you know if as you need to be doing sales um it usually might be good if the ceo is a person or whoever has a ceo title is a person talking to customers and and users and convincing them because they might feel a little bit more flattered if the ceo is pitching them and this kind of gets to the point of where really the only impact the ceo title has and that is externally and i would say specifically for investors so investors care about seeing that there is sort of a clear leader and a clear final decision maker or a tie breaker and that person should be the ceo so when you're pitching investors it's usually better for whoever is sort of does most of the talking whoever is going to be leading those conversations that that person is the ceo and now where you run into problems and a very very common source of co-founder friction we see at white combinator is where two people really want to be the ceo right and this consider we can see this in y combinator interviews where you end up with two people who kind of talk over each other they interrupt each other they can look at each other with a little bit of contempt and when the other person's answering these are all really really bad signs right so be honest with yourselves if you think it's really important to you to be the ceo and you both feel that way you're not good co-founders for each other so just avoid all that pain and heart take and don't start a company together you ideally want to start a company with someone uh who doesn't care about that stuff if you do or you're both indifferent to it and you're fine picking whoever you feel is best suited to the role for now even if that changes sometime in the future so let's kind of wrap up everything we talked about once you're sure you want a co-founder which i hope i've convinced you you do um once you run the process to find some good candidates to be a co-founder and you've identified someone that you really do want to start a company with because you spend a little bit of time working on projects together and testing each other out so to speak um then you have the conversations around what's the equity split and who's going to be the ceo now you're ready to formalize things and formalizing really means the legal act of incorporating a company um setting up a vesting agreement this is really important investing means that the shares in the company you don't all get them at once they invest over a period of time and there's very standard templates and documents that you should really ensure that that you have in place um and then you're pretty much good to go and you know the when exactly should you sort of leap from hey we're hanging out working together to hey okay let's like do some paperwork um not a perfect answer for that but it's just kind of a gut feel like once you like once you've made the commitment to yourself and each other that we are going to make a real goal of trying to build a company together that that's kind of the trigger for when you start making things real by getting into the legal cooperation and people have done so that's all the advice i have for how to think about finding the right co-founder and how to make it happen i hope that helps and good luck
