so this presentation on improving conversion rates it's designed to mostly focus on like landing pages but all of the principles and ideas that I'll talk about in this talk actually can help you improve the conversion rates of almost anything any user interface so keep that in mind this is a typical example conversion rate funnel and when you're trying to improve one conversion rate you're basically trying to improve the efficiency of going from one step to the next and the thing is why we care about conversion rate is because it's part of two different aspects of growth the two main sort of drivers and so growth is kind of like the balance between conversion and churn and basically growth happens as a gap between the two something to keep in mind is that working on churn is actually much easier than working on conversion so in this talk we're working on the harder thing it's the thing that usually are going to get started when I talk to a company and I'm trying to help them with their conversion rates the first thing I usually try to figure out is do we even need to be working on this at all so the only time you should be working on and improving your conversion rate is because you have a leaky bucket so I'd like to just talk about a couple of benchmarks into industry so that we've all kind of sit on the same page and understand whether like we should be working on this or working on something else like putting more things into the top of the funnel share where conversion rates here is about 0.5% so basically this is old-school like before the internet if people just released software out for free and they just hope that somebody will pay for it or have their own goodwill this is the conversion rate you can expect casual download games it's about 2% so stuff that you sort of play on and off while waiting in line most companies kind of care about this one freemium software as a service companies they range between 1.5 and 5% on average it's about 3% so once I talked to a company and they have pages that are converting at about three percent and that is from like out of a hundred visitors that visit your page two to three percent sign up I used to say you probably don't need to spend that much more time on this probably other things you should work on instead that being said you can do much better than that flicker it back in the heyday I had a conversion rate between five and ten percent Adult Friend Finder so depending on what you're selling people wanted a whole lot more so ten the twenty two percent for sex and end of loneliness even better so these are if you don't recognize them children's social networks and so basically this is the conversion rate to get your kid to shut the up right to leave you alone TurboTax Online the monster seventy percent conversion rate basically you're going to TurboTax you're downloading that software you are paying for it it is very very high intent every conversion rate problem looks like every other user interface problem and the concept or framework that I'd like to use to explain how to solve any user interface problem is using something called the knowledge spectrum this was created by a amazing interface designer named uh Jared spool and basically the knowledge spectrum says that this represents all knowledge on a spectrum and on this side represents zero knowledge no knowledge you don't know anything and another side is God like all knowledge your product and your user sits on two points on that line just two dimensions your user sits here at what we call the current knowledge point and your interface your landing page the thing you want them to do is it's here at the target knowledge point and every interface problem that's trying to be solved is trying to close what we call the knowledge gap that's it you don't need to go to a complicated design school to know how to solve these problems you either going to increase the amount of knowledge that is needed by your user or you need to decrease the amount of knowledge needed to use your product or interface that's it and I whenever I'm looking at anyone's a design problem I'm trying to figure out do I need to increase knowledge or do I need to decrease it so the most helpful exercise that I will use from this once I understand this concept when I'm trying to design a landing page or to improve it is to simplify things very very simply and what I imagine is something called the one-button interface so let's imagine that we reduced our landing page our product to just one button on a page the question becomes what do I have to put on this page to get someone to push the button what's the minimum amount and that's what you want do you want to have on there and now is there any information that I put on this page that keeps me from pushing the button or is there any lack of information that keeps me from pushing the button now for every time that I deal with any page that I'm looking at that I'm trying to help improve I basically go through a series of seven questions for every single one and then through the series of seven questions I look very smart you now can be smart on your own the first question I ask is what's the call to action is the button is the thing I most want my user to do is it super obvious where do I find it and the thing to keep in mind about the call to action is it should be really really close to a concept I like to call the magic moment the magic moment is basically the experience the knowledge the information the interaction that someone has with your startup and all of a sudden they get tingly inside the light bulb goes off they go holy I've been waiting for this my whole life I now get it this is super exciting I can't wait to use this and your call to action should be as close to that magic moment as possible that when I click that button I'm gonna be taken to that point so often I go through a design critique with someone I'm like what's your magic moment and then somehow the call to action is like 27 steps away from whatever it is that makes someone feel special or gets really excited about your product or app so do you should be as close to zero as possible from your call to action the six other questions we're gonna go through relatively quickly and then we're gonna go through two examples from people participating in start-up school just watch them in action the next question is what is this what is this magic moment right and my test for this my lips the MS test is like can I just copy paste a sentence on this page the sanding page that I can put into an email and send it to my mom and my mom goes I understand what this is 99% of time I look at people's websites and they're so filled with MBA marketing jargon and talk that there's no sentence that exists on that page that'll lets me to very clearly understand what it is that this company does is it right for me so people who are super in a rush impatient trying to solve their problems they're quickly trying to identify themselves there's like am I in the wrong place is this the right product and the way they're trying to determine that is to see like is there any reflection of themselves in this or any reflection of their problems look at it anywhere on the page is it legit so the threshold is very low here just can't look like a Russian spamming website right outside of that you don't need to overthink this thanks to tons of templates and themes out there you should be able to get over this bar very very quickly who else is using it so a lot of people are uncomfortable using a product unless they know that there's something else out there and you might think it's a variation of legette but again this bar is completely different it's letting me kind of know Oh a shortcut for is it right for me and is it legit and basically a shortcut for trust and people often are trying to say like oh if so-and-so is already using this then I should actually give this a chance how much is it what's the catch this is the one that so many b2b enterprise companies are afraid to put on their website and which is why we've paired this talk up with pricing and basically you should have some empathy how many times do you go to a website and go like well I'll use this without knowing how much it costs sounds good to me let's just do it no one does that and so you shouldn't be surprised that your conversion rates are affected because you don't tell people how much it costs or what's the catch so let's say you're giving away something for free and really your business models you make money some other way you should explain that to people because otherwise people feel paranoid or worried or feels kind of weird and then lastly is where can I get help there's always a percentage of users who will go to your website no Matt no it doesn't matter that you have all the fa Q's you've written everything down you've created these beautiful video documentation they will just go like I just want to ask someone I just need to talk to somebody I need someone to tell me directly and part of it is some people are just like I just want to see if there's a real person behind this that's number one or some people or just can't be bothered and sometimes it's easier for them to just directly ask then navigate through the website and if you don't make it really easy to find and contact you or make it look like that you were going to help them if they start using the product they probably won't use it this talk is so short so that's basically yeah those are the seven questions we are now going to go through two examples start school companies that um sent their stuff to me and I don't really have their permission but they did submit it when they asked to have a design creat critique done in the serb school forums so I feel like we're gonna be okay okay so the first one we're gonna do is meeting room dot IO all right first question what is the call to action what is it that this company most wants me to do and then what I do is I basically then try to do that thing and just follow it all the way through and just see how far away am i but in the magic moment so these guys create virtual meeting room platforms so basically um we don't have a copy-paste sentence but basically it's like you want to meet in VR space with someone you can use this to help create that space and create that sort of meeting I imagine it is get a virtual room right now there's a lot of things that are sort of competing with it for all the call to actions on this page and then we kind of don't repeat it down here that reminds me where to go so let's go to the most efficient get a virtual meeting room right now and then on here we have competing calls actions to download and then we have manage rooms and then there's a start here to get to your virtual room which is a carousel that walks you through seven steps to finally get to making a room but none of these are the actual forms to do it so you have to then go here and then hopefully you will remember all of those seven steps in the carousel and he'll walk all the way through it so things that I would recommend would be like I want to I've always one button that's very very clear that's what I want you to do on any given page number two I don't think this makes it easy to understand and I can't keep it in my head the follow it's good that they know all this steps but I would probably imagine that there's something that's going to help me experience that magic moment much sooner and what I imagine is that magic moment happens when I finally like make a booking and I meet with someone in a room together and we start interacting and we're solving something and I feel like if I can't do that right away then I want to have them be able to experience it somewhat so I would totally add some kind of video I think they have that kind of here that will kind of show it off this is this video is kind of long and it doesn't get it to that sort of magical place so that's number one second what is this so virtual meeting room platform but if I copy and paste it then I wouldn't quite know also you see this carousels kind of moving around carousels don't work very well because you're hiding information that I might want to have to answer any one of my seven questions and secondly oh god I can't figure out we do this thing where he calls in an open beta and so the legit part here starts getting it affected it's like oh I can't rely on this and then later on the signup page it talks about entering into the closed beta and so these are all things that indicate is like I'm not ready for you to experience this don't use me for any real meetings so what this sort of Telegraph's and so if this basically works I would try to move that straight forward to there down here we're trying to look for like who else is also using that so we don't have a list of customers instead we have a bunch of other logos here in terms of featured in a bunch of press that we have partners glad you don't know what that means and then we have a bunch of awards but none of them are actual people using it and so it's so many logos of other things that it would make me nervous that no one's really using this as a result and then lastly what do I get out we've got an intercom in the lower right and then we also have no help page no documentation to quickly sort of look at the see how this works and then the last one is good into pricing so here we get to this point and I realize okay I see this pricing if I need twelve people in a room it's going to be $99 a month and then I can start sort of working on it and it's one page over and if I go for the free again we'll go through all this whole process so a bunch of little things we just go through all the questions we can see a bunch of non-optimal stuff on this page let's go to our second example feel a little bit different so this is a company called div joy and so they described themselves as a react code base generator and then he has this one describe just use our free web-based tool to create the perfect code base for your next project so my first question I'm trying to figure out is like what's the call-to-action he most wants me to do and so as I scroll down this page there's actually nothing that looks like a giant button and actually the big thing he wants me to do is click on one of these templates these screenshots that are supposed to be the button so we have sort of an affordance problem and then we go into here and my magic moment is when I get over and realize it's like oh it's not just like landing page templates but it's like a dashboard it's like a sign-in page a pricing but it's like the entire project for building a SAS app this is all located here which i think is really amazing and nothing just tells me that that's what's all here and I might not find out until I export code and then I hit download and then I'll get the code oh yeah so where so many steps away from sort of experiencing that and also I feel it's so not explicit that I might miss how amazing what he's built here is in terms of what he's offering one thing he does kind of well is like he doesn't have like logos of customers but he has shown how many people have created or downloaded the templates so this number kind of sets that I oh there's people actually using this and finding it useful down here he tries to get at this everything you need is included and then he adds all this other text but all that text is there and that odds are your users aren't going to read them so because it's located into that copy it gets kind of lost and then again we have an intercom but there's just not enough information in terms of like essay cues right an about page that just makes me go like oh that this is more than a side project and so in terms of like how much I can sort of invest in this and how much I can rely on this down the road in the future is going to be minimal as a result great you
