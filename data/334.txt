okay what we're going to talk about today is how to apply and succeed at yc um in my capacity as the head of admissions i go around the world and i give talks and i meet folks that are applying and i answer lots of questions and so i think i have a decent internal model of the kinds of questions that people have and the kinds of things that people get hung up on and so i'm going to do my best to anticipate what you're probably thinking about and try to answer those to the best of my ability all right so why is it even worth applying to yc um people ask this question a fair amount of time and i would argue that the very act of completing the application forces you to think about stuff that you should definitely think about um for instance you know what are we building what is different about what we're doing than other options on the market who are your competitors that's going to want to ask here's one that sometimes people don't talk about before filling out the application what is your equity split you'd be surprised people often have never had that conversation and so the very act of going through and doing an application and working with your co-founder to answer all these things i would argue is an extremely good idea and regardless of whether you do i see again you should have you should ask yourselves all these questions and if you find a bunch of murkiness where you can't answer them that's usually a sign that it you should be discussing this more and so right off the bat i just i recommend going and answering the questions i think it's a good idea another thing is if you are watching this very presentation there is a good chance um that yc is a great fit for you right there's lots of people that apply and they don't really know what yc is and they googled like how to get free money on the internet or something um [Music] trust me i read these applications and it's clear that they don't exactly understand what yc is and what it's all about they just want money right um that is not you you are here you've been participating in this you have there's lots of context that you have um about yc and so that out of the gate means you're going to be much better prepared to fill this application um and that you're a great fit for the sort of company that we would want to fund okay another thing is i think a lot about what you should be doing as a founder in terms of cost benefit analysis on time there's a lot of things that seem like a good use of time that are not a good use of time and there's a lot of things that may not seem like a good use of time that are an excellent use of time and so i'd argue fill in an application should really only take you i don't know two or three hours and the potential upside is quite huge versus other ways you can spend two or three hours where the upside is is not much at all um so let's talk a little bit about how you create luck and this is sort of like a meta point outside of the application thing but great founders create luck and there's ways that you can create luck in your life that increase the chances that you will get lucky and the way you get lucky is you set yourself up to be lucky as often as possible and so if you can set yourself up so every single day of your life you have a shot it's something really fortunate happening to you the odds that something really fortunate will happen to you is like super high and i would argue applying to yc is definitely one of those things right um i answer questions and invariably people will probably ask me questions at the end of this that are some kind of a complicated way of being like of you talking yourself out of why you should do it for some reason that is not a great way to create luck and the fact is you're going to set yourself up um to be rejected all the time as a founder right you get customers your customers unsubscribe from your service um your customers are not happy you're gonna try to recruit people that may not work you know you're gonna be told no all the time and so if you set yourself up if so that you never hear no and that you never get negative feedback it's just like not you're not gonna set yourself up to actually be successful so this is an example like when i talk to people when i'm on the road um a lot of the questions or concerns that people have are all stem from this which is they're afraid of what happens if they don't get in and so they don't even bother to take the chance and again regardless of what i see in this particular topic i really think this is a good trait for you to develop as a founder we work on this in the program with people of really encouraging people to not be so afraid of getting told no and systematically trying to set yourself up for good things to happen to you as much as possible right and so this is just another of those situations so let's talk about some of the reasons that people don't apply this one is very common i am too early there is no such thing as too early um we fund people sometimes in the extreme case people have changed their idea between when they get invited to interviews and when they get to the interview that's an extreme case that's pretty early we also fund people that end up pivoting mid-batch and so that means they've been working on their startup like a negative number of days right that is clearly not too early also and so again there's this there's a lot of ideas around there that like the right way to apply to yc is to wait till you have a certain amount of stuff someone asked me a question what's the right amount of mrr to get into yc and like holy cow the answer is zero right that doesn't mean you will definitely get in every time clearly but any kind of roadblock you put for yourself that you're too early i would argue is your own self-constrained roadblock not something that's coming from us conversely people think they are too far along and this one is great because it's like uh there's like this ideal point between too early and too late that is like last you know a week or something and otherwise you're too far on either extreme um most likely you're not too far along we have folks every batch that come in we have folks that um man had over a million dollars in annual recurring revenue um folks that have had 20 or 30 employees uh folks that have raised a fair amount of money like whatever metric by which you think you too far and again maybe you are genuinely too far because you're like got a thousand employees or something um the odds are though most of the people ask this question it's because they are launched or um they have a little bit of revenue and they're like oh wow we don't need yc we got it all figured out and again our data and the folks that we worked with suggest that you are most likely not too far along depending on your circumstance so if that is the idea don't put the barrier into yourself on why you're not going to apply just cause you think you're too far along i'm too experienced this is where either you just oh yeah i went to business school or i've done a startup before okay that's fine but all you're doing is we're limiting possibilities there and i don't there's lots of folks that are super experienced uh justin khan did yc three times um and is now the founder of atrium and he gets something out of it every time and clearly he's very experienced and i would argue much more experience than many people that think this about themselves so again this is just creating barriers for yourself this is a common one there's something specific about my company that yc just doesn't get and um usually the way that i answer this is by listing all the types of companies that we fund um it is too long and too boring to list here so i will not attempt to be um to list them all but look whatever industry you're in whatever you're doing most likely we fund something kind of like it or equally crazy to that and we really like crazy and weird things and again why don't you make crazy weird i don't know we've funded nuclear fission and nuclear fusion startups and supersonic jet startups and like i don't know all sorts of crazy biotech stuff so there's it's unlikely that we're just going to be like wow that's that's too weird for us maybe maybe you are that one but most likely this is a barrier you're putting in for yourself this one's also really common people think if you do yc you have to live in the bay area forever that is not true a huge percentage of people that we fund you know you do the program here but that's three months then you go and do whatever you want right so if you're if you're super worried about like wow i just love new york city that's my home i want to be in new york city okay that doesn't preclude you from wanting to apply to yc okay there's more um i'll go through this quicker i'm a solo founder okay that's not a reason not to apply it's just again maybe you're afraid of rejection or you know that we encourage you to have co-founders that doesn't mean that's not a reason to not apply to yc um i've already applied to yc once before i'll address this later but just because you didn't get in once in no way means that you won't do it again so that's like not a good reason i've already raised some money i don't know the stats off the top of my head but a huge percentage of last batch had already raised a few you know on the order of six figures and there's definitely some seven figures as well and so in no way does it preclude you from applying to yc it's in fact extremely common um finally there's competitors sometimes they're you know if you're doing like a self-driving car startup or a scooter or startup or something there's other folks that we funded in the space we we fund folks in the same space all the time this does not preclude us from funding you nor is a good reason to not to not apply okay here there's not many but i do think there is a couple of good reasons to not apply one is you can you have the kind of business that is either not anticipated to be fast growing enough nor in your ambition is something that ever makes sense to raise venture capital for and if that does not make sense for you then yeah you probably shouldn't apply to yc like you should not raise any venture capital you should make the growth rate work for you and make the business model that works for you and that's a-okay right so no sweat that's a good reason the other thing is you're just not sure you want to work on this very long all right that's that's also a valid reason um we're used to working with people that are working on something very long time and so if you just want to do something for a few months or uh put this on your resume then yeah that's that's a fair reason to not apply how to apply okay this is really straightforward there's a website you go to the website and you follow the instructions um it's okay to apply early or late depending on your circumstances as jeff said um there are uh it's slightly harder to get in earlier late and that's just because we're not that's not our primary time to be cycling through things um but if that's what if those are the circumstances you're in um you should definitely apply this is a very common email question we get is hey it's two weeks after the deadline can i still apply guess what the answer to that question is it's a very quick yes but people want to ask they want permission and again this is a recurring theme about founders you need to learn you don't have to ask permission for everything you don't need our approval to do anything you know there's a website if there's a button where you can apply you should totally apply right you don't need to email us have a say yes and then do it that is an unnecessary step right um so just keep that in mind um and you can just email us and again most of these questions are just people asking should i apply and our answer is almost invariably yes but if you want to ask us you can there's the email address so let's talk about what makes a good application the first one i promise this is not redundant this matters and it's because i read so many applications i have a very good idea of what they actually look like and i realize that this talk will go on the internet and many of the things that i say will be reflected back like i'm creating a feedback loop for the things that i read and so things i'm putting in here are actually meant like i want these ideas to get dispersed of people knowing what makes a good application because i think that will make my job easier right so this is very intentional the first thing is that you would be shocked how many people don't actually fill out the dang thing properly like sloppy sloppy sloppy right there's like whole areas where they don't answer the question whatsoever they don't put in urls they don't fill out their bio i don't know it's again it's not a very long application you'll see yourself but it is shocking to me how what a high percentage of the time people just like don't fill the dang thing out or like put in lots of like errors and it's just like not great think about it about you know applying for a job or any other kind of professional thing lack of professionalism here not equated with success so just fill it out it's that simple and that's why i'm leading with this is you would be shocked how few people follow this direction maybe they think it's like a lottery ticket where they put it in an application and it's a bad one they might get in no humans read these things i read these things and i appreciate it if you fill out the application the second thing is the founder video you would be shocked how many people don't follow the dang directions there's directions on how to do the founder video i.e it should be a minute long all the founders should be in the video and people don't do that we get the 20 minute like spirit journey video where i don't even know what they're taught you know it's just like it goes it's yeah or like sometimes i've seen like an hour 20 i've seen some weird stuff but like the 20 minute spirit journey video not super helpful and i'm not it's really hard to sit there and watch something for 20 minutes um one minute is a perfect amount of time we give you examples those examples are great videos be like that video um it's also really good to have the entire founding team in the video people are always like hey i'm here and i'm in the airport and my co-founder is in here so here's my video and like i think that's fine if that's what you have to do but maybe just waiting a couple of days till you can be with your co-founder to do the video would be a good idea because my theory is a lot of times when people don't follow the directions and maybe because their co-founder doesn't know they're replying to yc like there's all these things under the hood where the lack of the co-founder in the video speaks volumes um and so maybe maybe you are have a great reason why your co-founder is in the video but i would suggest it right just and it's in the directions so i'm not telling you anything that's not in the directions i'm just letting you know yes we watch these things and yes it's valuable and if you just follow the directions then we're going to be super happy and when it's like either there's no video or the video is weird another thing that people do a lot is they put in like an unrelated video of a product demo that they made with one of those free tools where there's no humans in it and it's like i can't even describe it but anyway there's a whole genre of things that people put in there that are not remotely following the directions so please follow the directions i swear it matters clarity of thought this is a good application is easy to understand what they're talking about and it doesn't mean you write tons and tons and tons of words tons of words can definitely has a diminishing return where we don't know what you're talking about and it's i just can't understand what the application is saying also clarity on who's building the product it's remarkably obfuscated to even figure out what's going on and who's even building the thing like you'll see who the founders are and you'll kind of see what they're working on but it's really hard to tell who's building it and so just having it be very crisp of who's building it um again this is this would put you way better than average if you just do these things it's so simple right so good applications do these let's talk about clarity because this is definitely something that uh is worth talking about great applications that i read the application when i read an application and i know when i read it they're going to get in they're super easy for me to read it does not require a lot of work it doesn't feel boring or painful it just reads like with no effort whatsoever um and it's because i understand there's no jargon and everything just adds up and it's a great narrative and it's like wow what a great application and you move on it's very quick um weak applications obfuscate they obfuscate everything what is your idea obfuscated what who's on the team who's writing the code obfuscated how does it work i have no idea what is the state of the company are you launched do you have users what is it you have revenue but you're not launched what is that like like basically it's like a puzzle you pre when i'm reading one of these applications it's like a brain teaser where i'm trying to figure out what's going on and i promise this doesn't help i think a lot of the times that people obviously is they either think that that's what we want to read or we like buzzwords or we like this stuff or they're trying to hide something where it's not we're like the revenue is actually their personal salary but it's not revenue for the company but they're putting it in there because they think they should have revenue like stuff like that and so we'll ask questions sometimes to figure this out but there's such a clear delineation for me as an application reader about someone that is clearly communicating in a very crisp way versus where it's this brain teaser and i'm trying to pull out or it's just like tons of work for me to pull out the key facts from the application okay um and i think this is broadly applicable if you're trying to convince someone to buy your product or you're trying to convince someone to work with you or you're trying to convince an investor to invest in your startup and they don't even understand what you're talking about you have already lost right simply going for coherent understanding should always be the first thing you do before you're trying to sell someone right so if i don't understand what the heck is going on in your application it doesn't even get to the point where it's like hey should we fund this company or not we just don't know what's going on and you will notice that other people will check out like if you're trying to pitch your thing to someone they can't follow you there's no way you're getting them to yes and so i just think this is such a broadly applicable skill and something that we work on a lot in the batch is simply being clear and making sure the other party knows what you're doing first and then selling them comes second once they actually understand what you're doing so i put in a few examples here so here's some examples of really great descriptions from real yc applications from world yc companies that got in and so here's a company called remix and this is the entirety of their answer to this question there's not more this is it um i don't know i'm not gonna read it um out loud but like it's what three sentences and i read that and i know exactly what they do and i know who wants it and that's it great seems valuable right this requires so little mental effort to pull out what remix is and what they're doing and who it's for that i'm like great like takes two seconds to read okay here's another one for a company called tetra science also excellent or a software platform that connects scientific tools to the cloud it allows scientists to access their lab device from anywhere blah blah blah and we make a heart small hardware module which connects those labs to the web that's it that's great that's what we want to read see super chris understandable no jargon answers all the key questions notice they're not trying to sell us on any of this they're just explaining what it is and that's why this is so great is it's super coherent super clear here's another example from git lab when they applied to yc and they explain exactly what it is the history of the company and they also add in really impressive facts right at the top over 100 000 organizations use it including thousands of programmers at apple all right that's good glad they put that in there right and it's right at the top super crisp right so this is when we read these applications it's very clear what they do and we're like wow tell me more like i understand what you're doing here's an example of a bad one and i didn't pull this from a real application i wrote this myself and i wrote this based on many of the applications i read you know what i'm saying like i didn't have to think too hard to write what a bad description is um and it keeps going i couldn't fit it on the slide it keeps going for pages and this isn't even an exaggeration this is what a lot of applications are like and i understand like i have empathy for the people that apply with stuff like this because i think that they think that this is what we want or they think that if they use enough jargon or buzzwords that we will get confused and fund them or something you know it's like stunning us like oh i don't know blockchain okay yes instead this is arduous work that makes me like want to go take a break i'm like okay well i'm done like i read one of these and i need to go like get a breath of fresh air um this is a really hard to read it's really hard to understand what's going on and i still don't know i read this and i i've learned nothing i still don't know what this company does even after reading the application and so please don't apply with stuff like this it's not helping makes sense yeah and you do you see the crisp difference between this and the good examples yeah okay um great applications tell a story so here's the things that i would want to pull out of an application that i was reading um who is on the team so this is who we are this is what we're working on this is why we're working on it this ie how we got the idea something like that this is what we've accomplished thus far even if that's hey we haven't done much that's okay i still want to figure that out and this is why we're going to make this work and that's pretty much it these are the things that i when i read an application that i'm trying to pull out of it and there's nothing fancy here and if you make me work really really really hard to figure this out that's a scientific not a great application but if this just flows out without taking any effort whatsoever then that's a good application nothing fancy here right and if you've ever hired people and read resumes before it's kind of the same deal right you just look at a resume and you're like okay cool there's some key things you're looking for and then you're like sounds good and you move on right a resume that takes tons and tons and tons of work to make sense of is probably not a great resume okay here is my number one tip to applicants on what would help make it clear that there's at least one person on the team who can make the thing that you are working on and notice i'm being a little vague in that language because this is not just software this means any kind of technology that you bring to bear right so if you are building a cure for cancer you clearly are not going to have any programmers on that team nor would you be expected to do so but it would certainly be good if you're working on a cure to cancer to have some sort of scientist on that team does that make sense um same thing hardware you know our nuclear companies there were no programmers that were the founders of the nuclear companies but you would hope to see a couple of uh folks with phds and something related to the nuclear field right um so some sort of domain expertise and the reason is um we we fund lots of startups and if you have all these great ideas and no one on the team can actually do it you're going to have a hard time um and so just having a really good sense both in the application and in general i would recommend having someone on the team that can do it is highly recommended and changeable sometimes there's folks where the team does is not say you are working on something in software and there aren't folks that have the credentials or background where they're known software experts that's a-okay we still fund folks like this but the burden of proof is on them to prove they can do it i can think of an example of a company where it was like a self-taught programmer um that was so excited and wanted to do their idea so badly that they went and built the prototype themselves and it was in the application like here i milled this built this myself great they got in right um and it's because the burden of proof not just like let me take your word for it but you were able to show even though you don't have a background of an established software engineer you built a prototype and you brought it to market and you proved it and so that's a good way to think about if you're in this status of having a currently non-technical team of just simply backing up the fact that you can bring the market you can bring the product to bear whether that's from a team whether that's you learning from yourself whether it's a friend helping with a prototype just some evidence that you can bring the product to market is highly recommended um and like last note here is obfuscating this doesn't help right so sometimes people make it very vague who built the product or where the prototype came from or who's going to build it and like i don't recommend obfuscating this i think having to be super crisp on who is making the thing that you're working on is highly recommended okay if you have an application that actually follows the directions really well and is well written and does the video stuff correctly and you have one or more folks that can build the thing that you want to build and there's some evidence that you're serious about it and what i mean by that is um just like a lot of times people apply and it's clear they did it kind of on a whim and they're not actually serious about it whatsoever it comes across if there's just some evidence that you really want to do this um that's recommended so if you if you meet those things um you get about a four times higher odds to get an interview right like if you're doing this stuff getting an interview is not that crazy hard um and if you're not if you fail all these criteria then yeah the odds are are pretty slim and so it's as simple as this that this is you know this is the pro this is what it looks like to get an interview is that you meet these criteria and again it's pretty straightforward and transparent okay let's talk about applying more than once okay about a third of last batch were companies that applied already in the past and didn't get in and so the reason i say this is it's not bad to apply and not get in that doesn't ruin your odds if anything it helps you the way it helps you is that your next application shows progress if if you apply and don't get in and you apply again and you show progress i look at that when i'm reading the applications and i know we all do and we're like wow way to go they really went and did it like i'm so psyched like they went from an unlaunched idea and then the next application they launched it wow great job you know like we're we're impressed and this is another thing to think about is as application readers we're like on your side we're not looking at reasons to pick something apart we're looking for evidence that like you're serious and that like things are going well and you're trying really hard and so when you see someone expend real effort and make real progress application application that's such a strong signal right and this is why you see such a huge percentage of the folks that that do i see are folks that have applied in the past right is because it is such a strong positive signal one thing i wanted to mention is that you it's basically impossible to network your way into yc the whole reason yc was created was to make it easy for people that had no network to start a startup and get help and raise money and so the idea of having this website where you can apply and then you do a 10 minute review and you get funded was like really out there and weird i remember uh when oic launched that i was not working here so we don't expect anyone to have a network we don't expect anyone to network with us um one note on this is a lot i get the sense it's not a lot of people but some people attempt to cold email us a lot or do other things that are sort of stalkerish a lot and that does not help we don't expect you to have done that and the vast vast vast vast vast majority of people that get in are complete strangers we have never met before that's the entire system here is funding complete strangers and my guess is your time is better spent actually making your startup better than trying to like do some weird stuff to like get attention like we always have these really crazy attention-syncing things that happen and i can assure you we don't enjoy those things um again what do i mean like people email uh email they physically mail us weird stuff sometimes and like that's not great right so sometimes some some people put a lot of effort into this not a lot of people some people do and i'm just letting you know that this is not a good use of time um nor expected in any way and that's not how i see a setup another thing to think about is sometimes there are people you know in a network say alumni or other people and they will give you well-intentioned bad advice um for instance oh don't apply until you have 5k mrr or oh you know let me i i'm really tight with the yc partners so let me put in a good word for you or like you should be very skeptical of this stuff um self-appointed people that are giving you well-intentioned advice that's essentially putting up barriers between you and the process i would just be like really wary of that i'm sure it's coming from a good place but again a lot of times when i answer questions for people that applying some of the weirder ideas come from people that are vaguely in the network and so if someone's telling you you're too early or too far along or something something something i would be fairly skeptical right and again you don't need a network to get in so expecting the network to give you all the perfect device is not always great real real quick point this is not about yc but this the last topic you think of it watch out for predatory advisors so in the entertainment industry there's lots of people that want to be famous there's lots of people that want to be a recording artist or they want to be actors or directors there's a huge supply of them and one of the things of starting out in the entertainment industry is you meet all these people that claim to have great connections and they're somehow going to extract value from these poor naive people and it's really sad and this exists for sure in the tech industry where there are people that will just ask for equity or cash compensation and claim all the stuff and promise you the world and it's kind of a drag to see this exist and so i just want to encourage everyone to be very wary of people like this and to do research and that means googling them if they claim fantastic things look into that due diligence on other people they worked with in the past there's just like a whole variety of people that claim to help you break into silicon valley that i think is pretty dubious and there are some legit things in there but just like in the entertainment industry for every i don't know 10 people that claim they can get you a meeting with the head of all the labels to get you a record deal you know nine of those are probably lying you know so keep in mind the best way to have great things happen is to build a great startup and then great folks will find you and to be a little wary of some of the some of the folks that are looking for people just like you that are trying to break in all right so let's talk about interviews um if you get invited to interviews they last 10 minutes the interviews are in person we expect the full founding team to be there um there's usually three to four people from yc in the interview and the questions are usually very basic and what we're trying to do is just understand the nuts and bolts of the business it's nothing fancy just like i was saying about the application process people are surprised to learn that there's nothing too fancy here there's no trick questions there's no um really expert stuff we're just trying to understand really basic things like oh are you launched well how are you getting users okay what is the next step for the company how do you see this getting big these are all very very basic questions and we're simply trying to understand the stuff right versus um yeah actually let me go to the next slide so there's a lot on the internet about how to prepare for interviews and i think a lot of it is a little wrong and the reason it's wrong is i think it sets up the mentality that a yc interview is this adversarial thing that it's your job to beat right it's like the interviewers are your opponents and your job is to go in there and like stun them and confuse them and then if you fool us good enough then we will fund you and i think that that is wrong um and i i again i read this whole genre blog post because they're entertaining to me um and i think it's usually people that didn't get in that write that and so i understand how i can feel adversarial if you didn't get in and it's also more exciting to write a blog post about this really exciting interview and it was like they were grilling me so hard and i like had to think on the fly like that's more exciting than yeah we had a kind of a boring conversation about my business right and so i want you this is a good thing for any kind of working with investors i want you to put yourself in the shoes of the person on the other side of the table which is what are we trying to get out of the interview imagine you were interviewing a company what would you be looking for you'd be looking for basic answers to your question and you'd be looking for having a pleasant conversation that this is someone that you want to work with and that you're excited to embark on their journey with them right and so a lot of what i'm looking for in an interview is like can i have a productive conversation with this person and if someone goes in there and like spits out this like memorized paragraph of text about ai something that's like weird that's not like an organic conversation of someone you might want to work with that's someone going in there that clearly read way too many blog posts and spent way too much time preparing and is like kind of not understanding the context of the conversation which is hey like let's have a conversation about your company instead they're just like spouting nonsense at us okay and i feel like that's a consequence of people reading too many blog posts about this adversarial process because the fact is when we fund a company we are now working really closely with that company forever the founders and your group they they get your cell phone number they call you all the time they text you all the time like these become people that are really important member of your life and the people that i fund like they like this lasts a long time and so i just want you to know from our perspective we're just trying to get a feel of like okay like are we ready to really work with this company and get super involved and so remember you know have that compassion for the people on outside the table um versus making it really like a strange situation where uh it feels unnecessarily um i don't know memorized and painful for us on the other side of the table um and again like i think sometimes people try to manipulate the process and i don't if we get any hint that you're trying to do something weird again that's not a great that doesn't engender um trust i think that's the word we're looking for trustworthiness in a sense that you're we're we're getting to know the real you and those things so let's talk about a successful interview interviews do go really fast and they're intense and the reason they're fast and intense is we're trying to pull all the information out of you quickly and there's not a ton of time and so it's not an attempt to trip you up it's simply that that's how much time we have and we're trying to learn as much as we can successful interviews the founders demonstrate a mastery of their own business they can talk about what they're working on they know their own numbers they know how many users they have they know what their plans are they know what their equity split is like all the things that are in the application they are like yeah i can talk about that you know like oh i have a question when you said this about that in your application what did you mean oh yeah i have an answer to that right like we're just looking for you to clarify things that we may not have understood from the application um and so there's no such thing as a correct answer right this is not a quiz show this is not a beat the interviewers at their own game this is a legit we're just trying to understand what you're doing another thing is we know how risky this is and we know how slim the odds are in an interview are to succeed and so if you come in there being like everything's great everything's perfect i have it all figured out i'm confident like we're definitely going to be successful i promise like okay that's not actually good like it denotes a lack of self-awareness and so again if you over practice for these things and you think your job is to come in there and tell us how you have everything figured out and you're a genius and your whole team is geniuses and like it's like you cannot lose not a great sign um in an interview right so a good idea of what is hard about the business and what the challenges are is expected and recommended versus the things where you do have you know where you do know what you're doing does that make sense so yeah like overconfidence not necessarily a great you don't see this in successful interviews um you see self-aware founders if you are interviewed and not selected we send an email with some feedback usually the feedback is focused on a single thing which is what we are most concerned about or not convinced about in the interview and it's pretty transparent and straightforward and if you take that feedback and you go work on it and you apply next batch and you show how you either disprove the feedback or addressed it that is highly recommended and that's totally a great way to get into yc you see what i'm saying like sometimes people get these emails and then you never hear from them again or they like get really angry or something and like argue with you um but you can either prove it and show that the feedback is invalid like hey we're worried about your growth strategy blah blah blah we'll go prove it yeah we did grow here's what we did we love that we'd love to be disproven or hey you were right about the growth strategy and so here's the changes we made that's great things to hear too and so we um that's a great way to take this feedback into account is is demonstrate either it was not valid or that you've addressed it applying to yc is actually really straightforward and well documented and intentionally so so there are not a lot of secrets and we're not looking for people to do too much tricky stuff the more you can just like stay make it super clear tell a super clear story like i talked about earlier then you're going to do great and i would also argue the skills that you need to successfully apply are broadly applicable to what it takes to be a great founder right if you're going to talk to reporters if you're going to be talking to other investors if you're going to be talking to employees or talk to customers having all the skills that we mentioned earlier that you would want to see in an interview or an application i think are extremely useful okay and then final point if you have questions and the question is the form should i apply dot dot dot most likely the answer is yes and just always think about and reflect on if you're being the barrier to setting yourself up to being lucky or having fortunate things happen to you and and optimize towards saying yes to things like this i think i think it'll help you in general as a founder great thanks so much you
