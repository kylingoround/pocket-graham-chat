welcome we have Eric here today so Eric is a YC partner he was previously the CEO and founder of pebble which went through the YC batch and all the way winter of 2011 a long time you're gonna ban Eric so now we have the other building on the other side but my Y C batch was one of the last ones in this small small building yeah you actually it was called Alberta when you applied yep and our product was called impulse impulse yes we had a whole bunch of complicated name how did you I mean pebble is a great name how did you get to a much better name yeah I think the original names were found using a thesaurus or some sort of like we just like scan through a book for words that were related to like alerting alert ah that was how we got to it yeah originally peple was much better name I actually thought of it while lying on a beach and it was like two years before we actually made pebble I just like wrote it down in Evernote on a list of good names nice you never know you have no idea when you're gonna use another name so any good ones just written down so today I want to spend a little time talking about hardware startups giving you ran one especially one that was one of the larger hardware starts in the past few years but then spend a bulk of the time talking about hard tech because you spend a lot of time working with our tech or here at YC and there are a lot of unknown still out there and we obviously want to fund more of those couldn't startups so starting with pebble so can you take us through like a quick story up you know when you came to I see how big were you what did you doing well I see like that's actually a common question of what hard for startups actually do what I see in three months so we applied to YC started the company in 2008 started working on it while I was still a student at Waterloo kept working that through 2010 we hadn't actually shipped or we were we were just starting to ship the product to first customers this is before couple back into in mid-2010 and I've been on Hacker News forever but I never really understood what Y Combinator was I just thought it was like the domain name for Agri news and one day someone said hey you should check out like YC and so just on a whim we applied the video we recorded if I look back at it was during Oktoberfest in Kitchener Waterloo where I was living and we were wearing like Oktoberfest Macedon video we applied for some crazy reason Paul Graham Jessica and the gang decided to accept us even though I think we were the third hardware company that got through we started YC in 2011 in the winter and the company the stage of the company was we had shipped maybe take two or three hundred of our very first watch the watch that that was called impulse that worked with blackberry smartphones and we had some early customers we were getting money but we hadn't we were hit we were earning some money hadn't raised much I think I borrowed fifteen thousand bucks from my parents got some government grants in Canada which was quite easy but we hadn't raised any money from investors YC was the first first investor so $15,000 let you manufacturers at the first one hundred units I we ended up making them had one by one actually so the first watches for this first watch they were manufactured we bought the circuit boards from China we had the metal the kind of metal casing of the watch made at a small metal shop a guy had a CNC a five axis CNC printer or a mill and he actually just like he read about us in the school newspaper or something like that and offered to like be our first shop for making the actual metal cases so the middle case would get made just to write like couple blocks away you get the circuit boards shipped in from China we also made the plastic watch straps in China and then we would do the final assembly one by one in the garage and I think that early process of making everything one by one was perfect for us because we screwed up everything you could possibly screw up the first ten watches we had weight a lot of problems but we had problem with RF we couldn't get the signal out of the watch because it's like a Faraday cage sitting on your wrist and so we said well maybe let's change the metal back for a plastic back and so we had a whole bunch of laser-cut acrylic you know she got a plastic cut to the same size as the back of the watch and we kind of jammed it in and then we shipped the first ten of them out by FedEx and on something like seven out of the ten the electronics just exploded at the back of the plastic and like people would show us pictures of like this watch the vigeous Bob with like the guts just everywhere and so we adjusted the thing we started putting like up like a piece of foam rubber inside the watch so when we shipped it the the backswing explode but it was a really good thing that we were making them one by one or else we could have potentially made like hundreds with that same problem right at the beginning and had lost you know so we I think we iterated really really quickly and we screwed up it was only a maximum of like a pretty small screw-up and how many units were you that you sold before you actually went through the entire manufacturing process we continued to manufacture hand by hand one by one by hand up until around 700 800 units so even when so one of the things that people ask about YC is like well what happens if I have like have to move my business to to Mountain View you know it's gonna interrupt my production process or whatever so what we did was I hired a couple high school students and I asked one of my friends who I went to school with who was doing his master's back at Waterloo just kind of like manage and run the the production thing and they would ship him down here and we would finish it in our house that we were all living at and so I think the trick there was like we didn't we didn't let the fact that we had to be here in Mountain View interrupt our actual like sales process and so after YC pebble obviously took off and lots of great things happen more of it I mean he went through lots of ups and downs it's a year after YC it wasn't like immediately after took a long time yeah so what was the hard part maybe out of your old journey with pebble looking back I think it's different because you know seeing it forward it actually took us a long time to get from the initial idea to any sort of like real product market fit it was five years so we started the company in 2008 built the initial prototype late 2008 2009 since start shipping until 2010 and that was for our first watch and then we you know had a lesson had a lot of lessons learned from that first production run and then we redesigned and created what would become pebble in 2012 so that's five years and the hardest thing like I would say we work with a lot of founders and the hardest question that I think I ever get as someone who helps startups is like how do I know that what I'm working on is the right thing to work on how do I know that this little pivot that I could do is not the right one like maybe I should try that and there's no answer to this it is the hardest problem and so I you know thinking back I think it was probably very misguided in that I just had faith and I just never gave up even though now thinking back it's insane doing something for five years like what's the definition of insanity doing the same thing and hoping for different results like I was basically doing that for five years like we were just I guess we didn't know what we didn't know like we were very naive and we had a very small amount of money and we didn't know that you're not supposed to make consumer hardware products on a budget of $40,000 like most electronics that you use are made with budgets of millions of dollars I mean but now that you've done it or you did do it do you think it's possible now it's todya hotspur who know what I'm saying is I think like the hardest part that we had to go through was not letting other people get us down and kind of like maintaining that naive it say one of the things that I really love about like that phase at startup was people couldn't really convince us that what we were doing was wrong because no one had really done it before and if people said like oh you know you should you know and you should look at raising more money or something like that me did really have the resources to do that like we were very we were very constrained and naive team and so he had to figure it out and I think some of the ways that I could screw it up was actually the ways that I did screw it up was right after YC we raised a bit of money about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars including this this kind of large check that we got from one investor and I took all that money and invested in inventory because I thought at the time the biggest constraint on us growing was we didn't have a reliable like we didn't have a large amount of imagery we were making them by hand and so we only had like 10 or 50 a week and I was under the mistaken impression that if we could start selling it in real time rather than saying we'll do a pre-order in celle - in a couple weeks that our sales would have taken off more because then we tried this we manufacture we instead of making them by hand you know in our garage we went to a small contract manufacturer in San Jose and manufactured 3,000 at once and spend all of our money on that and you know you know I'll see that the story is going it takes longer than you expect to bring up a new manufacturer so it took six months or eight months instead of three months it cost more than we expected so the BOM cost Road rose and then by the time we actually manufacture them that eight months rolled around our email list of potential customers had kind of dried up everyone had switched from blackberry to using iPhones and then we were stuck with a whole bunch of inventory so that yeah that was a really that was a really rough yeah difficult part yeah it's often not always but in many cases people get really creative when they don't have much money it may have to get really scrappy and then when they raise a ton of money they forget how to do that later we raised a bunch of money and then started hiring it and this is a big problem even mostly the successful companies run into and so I think the moral of the story for me at least how I think about you know that I work on is like that that frugality is vital to me not everyone has the same and not every industry is exactly the same if you crazy industries right now which are kind of by definition the opposite approval I'm thinking of like the scooter scooter sure where it's a matter of like raising as much money and it's physically possible but for the vast majority of people like staying frugal is what actually like yeah if you don't have Network like obvious network effects our first mover advantage then usually you should get on the other path so pebble is known as one of the most you dip them one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns on Kickstarter and so a lot of people view crowdfunding is a way in lieu of fundraising to do that route so I think there are a lot of questions on what is the right time to do it especially like at what point do I need a you know a product that is real and it works do I need to align that with the crowdfunding campaign and so forth so what's your advice on that I have a after having gone through a couple of these cycles here's my advice I think crowdfunding can be useful for two specific points I mean mainly useful for two specific points in a startups like you could use crowdfunding at the very early stage when you have an idea on the back of a napkin maybe a render or two to raise twenty five fifty thousand dollars that can help you get to a working prototype this is for people who are software engineers and are experimenting or want to work with hardware this is for hardware engineers who have zero money and they just want to like do they just want to prove that some people want their product so I want to be very specific like this is it this is an intention play it's not trying to be to build like a multi-million dollar campaign with like super fancy CGI graphics and overproduced videos like I'm talking about people honestly saying I just need a little bit of money to get this idea off the ground and I think there's an opportunity to use crowd right there it can be as simple as just emailing a bunch of your friends and saying hey do you want to just want one of these this is like the best test that you could that you can have for early product market fit is do your friends and family actually want to pay you money for what you're making or do le customer to actually want to prepay for what you're making it's not perfect because you know they may want to try it first or something like that but if you are making something that people really want they're basically throwing their money at you so that's it that's an opportunity for kind of this early crowdfunding I really encourage people to not try to do the marketing blow out campaign at the start for two reasons one is just looking back most of those campaigns even if they do succeed at raising money usually fail to produce and actually ship their product and I think the reason why is going through this cycle of having to make something and ship it to customers is really educational and you also learn what people like about your product or what they don't like as quickly it's like you reduce the amount of time between you having the idea and you're getting validation of do people actually want this idea so that's the first I think opportunity for crowdfunding I think there's actually another opportunity using it more as like a marketing and sales channel which I think more of what we did where we had already made most people don't know this but when we launched our Kickstarter campaign we had already made and sold around 1500 of our first watch and so we had gone through like all the pain and the cycle of building that and we had a really good idea of what pebble should look like because we had feedback from about 1,500 individuals who were like super eager early adopters very open with their feedback and we tune and tweak the product so I think there's kind of like two separate crowdfunding opportunities and like a consumer products life cycle I think too often people blend them together or they don't know which path they're on and so they kind of screwed it up they they there's actually a couple other platforms for this early crowdfunding there's you know Kickstarter and IndieGoGo and that kind of thing but there's also tindy there's crowd supply there's like hackaday forums it's a lot of like really niche areas where you could you go to a discord server and say like you don't have to use the Kickstarter platforms for that early phase do you suggest having like a date in which you know I can promise you I can actually deliver this because if I'm using Kickstarter with the first with you know the first route maybe I don't know that I can deliver it within six months is there's like a certain time period in which I know I can deliver then I do that and if you're not like I would I would encourage like if you're not confident in your ability to ship it then don't use one of these like crowdfunding campaign platforms where it's very centric like shipping centric there's other options and again like I really do encourage going through that first cycle to find out things like how long does it take me to make things do I have all the skills on my team or do I actually have to find you know people potentially in the community to help contribute software or other other skills to the team again like too many people I see like they skip that step and they try to go directly to like the high-powered marketing campaign and it's just it's just such a sad time most of the time yeah and sometimes there's on Kickstarter kind of early adopters yeah but there's a group before now exactly I think for your given industry and for your given product category you should be able to find it like sometimes it's as simple as going on like a subreddit like we've had some great companies come through YC and they do their initial sales just by earning credibility in a Facebook group or they earn credibility in a reddit you know group or discord like there's a ton of customers there so when you talked about pep Laura Lee talked about hiring people and outsourcing things what's the right call in terms of outsourcing the various components so this is a really hard question for hard tech companies because more often than not the skill sets that you'll need to build to build your products are actually quite varied you may need a mechanical engineer an electrical engineer a computer engineer some you know production people ops people and you don't necessarily need 100% of that person all the time you need like 15% or 20% for three weeks and then you're back to not needing an electrical engineer so the best the best way to solve this is to have really flexible technical people on your team where you guys can just kind of incorporate everything and just do it yourself because those teams move so much faster than teams that require an external kind of process some of the most painful moments of my early career were not having full-time co-founders and having to work with contractors or consultants who honestly like you can't pay someone enough to care I mean firstly because you probably don't have that much money but also because people who are working on contract they're just set up to not have the same motivations than the same alignments that someone who's working 24/7 trying to get their fledgling startup off the ground has you run into time commitments I just had got an email the other day for my founder who's like yeah our intern went back to school and he was developing a large portion of our company and so yeah so like I actually opted for in the early days and pretty much all days trust and dependability and and and kind of smartness over very specific deep domain specific knowledge in who I'm looking to hire so last question on hardware specifically there's this common saying or adage what do you want to call it like hardware you can't just build Hardware you have to have a software component so that just scales you can have like a subscription service on top of it instead of just the one off type purchase how much do you believe in that or what do you think about people who say that all the time so I've been I've been working on I've been doing a bit of research into this category it's really got me interested right after pebble because that was some feedback that we often got could you launch a subscription service could you have some sort of payment subscription and you've heard of product market fit right you know the idea that customers really you know in a particular market are going after your product I actually think there's something called like business model company fit where you could have the best product in the world you could actually have product market fit but if you have the wrong business model you're not gonna be able to fund and you know grow your company over the long term so it's kind of like an advanced thing but you don't need to worry about this if you'll have product market fit because you know how product market fit you know you don't have a company but we ran into a problem pretty soon after we hit product market fit of misunderstanding what was the what was the business model that was going to drive this company and I think there's actually like seven or eight or nine different business models that are useful that that are kind of like lanes that hardware companies or heart tech companies can can use I've been working on the kind of just kind of researching and putting companies into different categories and you have the subscription companies like the nests and the or the dropcam's of the world that are selling you know ring healthy three to ten dollar subscriptions per month but then you see other companies that try to do something similar and it just does not work and I think that's because so in our case we didn't struggle I think with subscriptions we experimented with it it wasn't really going to work for us but the way that we screwed it up was we didn't understand that we were in hits driven market hits driven being you come up with a consumer product hopefully it's a hit it hits that product market fit and people start pulling it out of your hands similar to a game company we didn't realize that we had to be super frugal super kind of low budget as we developed the new products and kind of tried to engineer another hit our first product was certainly a hit I don't think we ever reached escape velocity to a hit with any of our later products and I think if we had built a more frugal organization if we were able to build products cheaper and then launch them and test to see if they were successful and they were successful scale it up etc I think we might have had a slightly different outcome and it kind of goes back to like there are these different models for hardware companies and you need to like you need to you need to make sure that you're on the right but you have to question yourself and you're like should we really be on a subscription model is this really what customers are gonna want what they want to spend five dollars ten dollars a month and you can't force it and if you force it like I think we tried to do you you might add extra problems like on top of just building great products for your customers so pivoting a little bit too hard tech so we've funded lots of cool hard tech companies lately quantum computing self-driving cars pretty printing entire homes so for agriculture technology yeah nuclear fission nuclear fusion aerospace space space yes Rockets satellites and rockets so I mean we can calibrate the conversation a little bit how do you define hard tech deep tech what does that really involve for me I think what what I'm excited about you know in harder technology spaces is that is the in the in the software world the iteration cycles are quite short you can push code to your to your repo and have it go live within seconds and so you can rapidly iterate on your product and get feedback from your customers I think hard tech companies can't they don't have this same rapid iteration cycle they either have hardware in the mix which kind of is not at that same speed yet though it is it is dramatically decreasing the amount of time that each iteration cycle takes or you might have some sort of fundamental technology that you're working on that needs to be developed in order to unlock a new business model or new use case or you might be regulatory regulatory constrained either in the medical device space drone space transportation space software on car space these are all like there's external processes that you can't control that affect your iteration cycle time so say this crazy idea something to do with rockets or something insane it's to most people normal to me of course rocket scientist and I have no money what away what do we even start what do I do it doesn't cost that much money to get started these days you can do something like startup school where they give you free money to invest in like if you're working on AR machine learning you can use that to get compute credits well maybe a better question is what is an MVP for most of these yeah Carter Tech so for medical devices I think the MVP is successfully peer-reviewed science that supports what you're working on that that there's not that there's some sort of opportunity here and a kind of understanding of what your path to clearance is those are in my opinion I think the best companies because they're the ones who have shown that they understand which business model they're in and they know what's going to take what's gonna be taken of them to get to kind of sales but they don't necessarily have to be like too far along that path I think at that stage investors start to get excited when they see the mating of science Senna and a use case we've had a bunch of companies that are working on rockets and satellites and propulsion and that kind of thing for those cases it's usually some sort of subset scale representation of what you're working on and customers so in all cases even if you're working on regulatory constrained products having customers either contributing money to you through early contracts or or further along on the kind of pilot track the better I think oftentimes engineers we love to build things we don't as much love to sell them and so what I look for in early-stage companies is are the founders technically competent and do they understand that they're gonna have to kind of perverse themselves become salespeople or not what do you find by demo day when they're in front of lots of investors what is it that you encourage them to accomplish by then it sounds like there's two passers the if you can do sales there's no regulatory issues to doing sales you should have some paid contracts ll eyes maybe and then also a technical validation like proof that you can actually built this yeah and I think too often people convolve these and they say I don't want to do sales until I have something that I can show to them that's just not true most customers if you explain that they have a problem and you have a way to solve it they'll get excited and if they're not excited it's probably a sign that they don't really have a problem that they want to solve and so oftentimes we get companies that come in at the beginning YC and they say well we want to spend the first two months you know working on improving the prototype and getting it to the point where we're proud of it and then we'll do sales in the last month and you know we kind of flip that around like do the sales hit the pavement like talk to customers and you'll actually build a better first product for them than if you just built it first and showed it it also gives you confidence that you're going down the right track someone said it's hard like we had a company in the last batch that had been working for two years on building a prototype they were commercializing some technology that they worked on in a university and it had a hardware component and I remember seeing I think was their third application second or third application to YC and they had kind of similar videos of them doing the demo with their technology and we you know we liked their commitment like they had been coming back and the technology was getting better and they were just starting to talk to customers and we said let's give him a shot and so we brought him in for an interview accepted them in and then basically the first week we took him aside and just said you need to start selling you need to get people like excited and interested and it was almost like a 180 for them because they thought that we were going to say you should work on technology and get to the point where you have like working units widgets that you can sell and we said no like start going and talking to customers and they it took a little while for them to get up to speed they you know it's a it's like exercising your new muscle especially for engineers and within span of two months they went through several rollercoasters of like having zero leads to having a whole bunch of leads to having them all collapse and no one's signing and then like six or seven weeks into YC they they they sense no and they were like we got our first we got our first contract and then they got their second contract they got their third and then like my demo day they had already had already like line on four or five million dollars in sales and that all happened in the span of three months because they've kind of you know stopped working necessarily on just building their technology they were still working like they had a three or four person team so they hey they were able to split it up but the focus that number one goal became how do we get sales so say I mean you do a lot of trips where you go to schools specifically you talk to scientists and engineers many and peach tea programs because what is what is your advice to them to make the jump which they consider a lot of them are thinking about commercializing it but maybe they think I don't know what they think actually but but what is your I guess went like one-two punch on that having started my company in a kind of university town versus somewhere here like Silicon Valley I felt very kind of protected there were a lot of government grants I was able to raise non dilute of funding and Plus that is we were able to use that funding to work on the project but the downside was there was no pressure to have some sort of product that customers would pay money for it wasn't really in the DNA of the startup kind of ecosystem that I was in most people were just entranced with working on their startup and not necessarily getting to that next stage of building kind of a profitable longer-term Corp and I think that that sometimes affects people who are in universities even more because the the the default is raising money through grants and working on longer-term projects whereas the special case is like spinning out a company and actually like trying to get customers to buy it and I think what I would encourage is like try getting out of your comfort zone just as an experience like or experiment don't don't say that you have to like dive in headfirst with no parachute but if you're working on some sort of technology that you think could have some sort of positive business impact like get out of the lab go to some conferences talk to people not not educational conferences like corporate you know sales conferences start talking to customers and see what people think and like that's that's the start and hopefully I mean if you're if you're lucky and things are in the right spot again customers will be like where's this been all my life like this is this is amazing this is exactly what we've been dreaming of I can't believe it finally came out of the lab and that should be the momentum that just like pulls you pulls you along but you have to get out to please try it so so you get to the point where you feel confident you have like some amount of interest in your product but to actually build it you can eat lots and lots and lots of money what do you need to show to investors so the best the best companies in my opinion are the ones that don't require a ton of money to work on or at least to get to some sort of MV MVP stage kind of like with all advice that once he gives it's usually applicable to 90% of the companies and there's always 5% on either side that are in a special case but even some of the best hard tech companies I've seen they don't have like a binary outcome where they need someone to insert a hundred million dollars and that's the only thing that can develop the product like take I mean I don't know anything about these companies in other than kind of press reports but take kind of magic leap versus oculus right magic leap raised lots of money and spent 11 years working on a product versus oculus which raised two million dollars on Kickstarter shipped a you know early development development kit that was not amazing but they iterated and they got through and now the oculus [Music] the new one that's like 400 bucks doesn't new computer like it's it's exactly yea the quest like that's exactly what people are dreaming of now and they're gonna have it within six months and they had to go through like six seven years of like painful iteration but they did it and yeah so last question then we'll take audience questions what's an idea just so curious what's an idea that sounded so crazy to you when you heard about it but then when you met the founder and they stepped through everything or like oh that's not so crazy this is totally possible relativity space so that was company that went through YC for three years ago not very long they wanted to build 3d printed rockets their thesis was it's not actually rocket assembly that cost a lot of money it's the testing phase of integration or if you have hundreds of different systems that have to work perfectly with each other when you assemble and build the final rocket you have to test everything select a different path than like SpaceX which is going for the reasonably T thing so their their thesis was if we can 3d print the entire rocket from the tip of the exhaust to the motor to everything in like one piece the integration time is zero because you just print it so they're working on this and it was just an idea I think they did a hot fire during YC I think they were working on it I don't know exactly how long they've been working on it for but yeah that's pretty crazy idea and to come through YC especially to pitch to investors that probably were not you know all space investors must have taken some guts but they did it they showed off their first three printed rocket they raised early funding off of that they started work on their larger products and raised a whole bunch more money I think they just raised their P or C last year they also they worked at previously at SpaceX origin but they didn't have many years of experience so it was actually craziness ends also they were extremely young and for this kind of thing - yeah thing in this and people people believed in their in their vision they demonstrated enough I think of what they were working on and I think it was actually interesting so I think they I don't want to say too much in case I'm wrong but I think they were working on the printer first and they were looking for an application for this massive metal 3d printed they'd built and they found space as the I mean it was their background and their passion so I think that's the one that they took it in the direction that they took it in I see this a lot with people who are working on really cool kind of fundamental technology I think PG actually had a pretty good tweet about this couple weeks ago he said like if you're in a situation where you're building something that's like mind-blowing ly cool and revolutionary but you're finding that customers don't want to buy it pivot your companies so you're actually doing what your customers would have done and just use your pioneering technology to do what they do faster better or cheaper and sell to their customers and that's kind of I think what relativity did is they were building this new 3d printer and they realized that we could just build rockets with this technology and we will be better than everyone else who's building rockets in that space cool so questions first so the question was how do you get your first customers how do you get one through 50 I talked about this a little bit earlier some of the best ways is to kind of infiltrate the community of people who want who you think will watch your product there are an unlimited place unlimited set of places on the internet where people talk about products and they talk about services they can range from you know where the whatsapp guy posted his app first in back in 2009 now he posted it on flyer talk for which is like a whole bunch of like geeky business people who fly a lot and that's where you posted it and like think about that as your first as the first kind of user group for whatsapp it's perfect right it's travelers who want to talk to people all around the world who are tired of paying for overpriced like SMS bills and it's 2009 so people are just starting to get like smartphones and that kind of thing perfect like you couldn't have planned it better if you tried and so the best companies are the ones that just kind of get out there for us we got a lot of press in the early days by talking to bloggers so I like formed personal relationships with all of the BlackBerry bloggers at the time if anyone remembers CrackBerry CrackBerry Kevin yeah and so I would like fly out to conferences on like their cheap red eyes and just like instead of buying tickets to the conference I think we were just kind of like sneak around and get into the print like once at CES back in 2009 we just just walked into and gadgets trailer like Engadget had this big trailer where all their reporters were working and we didn't know anyone so we just walked in and then just started like pitching to people and ended up getting us through this like a picture of my wrist with a broken watch it didn't even work at the time but it's like so-and-so is working on a SmartWatch and that drove a ton of traffic in the early days was just kind of people's self identifying as this was something that that I wanted yeah takes a lot of hustle yeah things are much easier so the question is like we're a bunch of software engineers we have an idea that had includes software and hardware how do we get started on the hardware well the good news is that it's easier than ever I wrote I wrote a blog post that was on TechCrunch a couple months ago about how software engineers can kind of get started on this and the recipe is pretty simple find an off-the-shelf product that kind of what you want to do that's kind of like halfway there that you can actually just buy off Amazon or Alibaba or something because the amount of like the amount of time and money and tears that you'll save just by buying a product that's halfway to what you want to build will will do a couple things one is it will get you within two to three days or however long shipping takes an actual physical representation of what you think you want to build and you will begin to use it hopefully to solve the problem that you want to solve and you will learn like maybe I'm completely wrong and this often happens like the best intention product when you actually build it might not actually solve the problem that you want to solve so getting halfway there for like two hundred bucks or three hundred bucks plus shipping it's just so much better than weeks and months of prototyping just to get to the same kind of level the next step after this is to take the 50% their product or 75% their product and hack it to do what you think is better either adding a little bit of technology onto it adding your software stack modifying it can be as simple as like repurposing the same technology and like it's changing that changing the setup a good example of this would be kind of a scooter companies they took Xiaomi scooters you know nine bought scooters and they just glued on cell modems that's it that that's how scooter sharing starts like cell modems and GPS plus scooter he didn't build this scooter themselves they bought it off Alibaba and they bought the modems from some company that was making modems so that's kind of the prototype I think for the next generation of consumer hardware as well as enterprise hardware we had a company two batches ago that builds cameras for neighborhoods neighborhood security and they used a Raspberry Pi in a PI cam and a 3d printed case and they sold those for like hundreds of thousands of dollars the hardware cost you know very small amount of money and they're just solving a real problem for end customers and people are paying them in exchange for that so yeah it's it's even easier than ever you can find people in Alibaba you can meet factories over reach at just don't try to build it all yourself don't hire like an industrial design firm to build you some new design don't hire like an engineering firm that promises to do a custom design for you because that'll cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and it probably will be the wrong product versus spending 300 bucks find something meeting the factory that makes that current product and asking them to kind of make the changes that you want to make it depends so the question is should you move should you move closer to changing or factories when you are pre product market fit if your free product market fit and you have a product that you're iterating on like figure out a way to reduce the iteration cycles so that you get more chances to dazzle customers and to find you know that product market fit so you could solve that two ways if you think that moving to the factories would be--if will enable you to do faster iteration and you already have kind of sales channels set up that's cool if not and you don't really have that many customers then move closer to your customers so that you know the iteration can be done in software maybe not hardware and you're just like spending every minute in front of your customers so we have a couple companies that did that in the last batch and they were using drones to solve very specific business process problems and they basically just moved to where those businesses are took up like a motel a crappy motel room and turn that motel room into a like a drone factory where they were making and modifying their drone and that in that case you know was probably recall for them protection IP protection trademark protection is that kind of what you're interested so yeah patents that kind of thing so this question I think kind of touches on how do you build a moat for your company how do you make sure that once you figure out a beautiful product figure out who to sell it to that some other dude doesn't come along and just steal your idea so there's a couple ways that you can solve this the best ways in my opinion are companies that have some sort of innate moat where it's either Network effect where the more people that use your product the better it is for everyone or some sort of data a lot data lock-in where you use the product you generate data the davida happens to be within one ecosystem someone who builds a competing piece of hardware can't get that data easily those are the two best what do you think about that I think those are good I also think patent previously used to be very hard to get but now there's like we have a company called cognition IP I would just use them and you pay them some amount of money they use software to help you file so the the problem with patents is that they're not like if you're thinking about this problem specifically how do we block other people from copying our idea they're actually really difficult tools to use versus those other two things that I described that are actually like you control all the levers if you can build a product that has built-in network effect or built-in data's you know things you control that you don't have to rely on lawyers you don't have to rely on the government you'll have to rely on the courts to enforce your domain dominance but if you were if you rely on patents or that kind of thing you're basically saying I I I'm putting this money down as an investment but I'm gonna have to invest a lot more money later in order to use unlock that first investment so it's very rare that startups build a successful moat using patents this happens much more in like biotech so yes yeah I agree with that I think the I think building really great product is really just the only way to really build the moat I mean again for like 5% of companies there might be some sort of patent strategy be a 95 percent it's it's great products yeah I think if it's also easy to build people just copy it even if you get that and so it doesn't really no that's the thing you need money to enforce the patents you need time to enforce it and if your companies dead it's hard to enforce patents [Music] marginal markets are great so the question was what happens if I'm building a hard tech problem longer-term trying to solve a longer-term problem that first problem that I'm solving what if it looks too small honestly the best investors will want to see a small market because a small market at the beginning means you can identify who's in that market very cheaply versus having to boil the ocean saying well there's like two percent of all people in the world who are interested versus like eighty percent of this one group so it's cheaper and easier for you to find those customers the second thing is that small group of people will tell you quicker whether you have a good product or not because they know what the they know that they have a problem and you're telling them hey buy this thing solve your problem they can use it in big yeah that solves it it's good yeah problem solved they'll give you feedback whereas if you're trying to again target like a really large group with a vague product idea it's gonna be harder to know whether that person just was interested that week maybe didn't have enough money you know there's there's more reasons than you had a bad product if it's a really vague in large large market yeah just add on to that I think starting small is good but also having a road map to how it builds into something big as good as well for investors specifically and for yourself as well to know like keep keep motivated feminine so in my company by chance we just like to it's an electronic treatment for reducing sweating and we we are so happy that people are so this cuz this questions related to like do I do I pick a recurring business model subscription business model hardware is a service or do I just sell the product so this kind of goes back to what I was talking about before which is making sure that you have the right you you're pretty sure that you're in the right business model track for your company so there are a lot of these different tracks they're not just hardware's a service not just consumer there's hybrid models there's insurance models there's you know advertising driven models there's a ton of different ways that you could look at it so it's not just one or the other here's what I would say on the enterprise side you need to figure out how much money you will save your customer or how much more money they will make and price your product accordingly like your product price to them will be less than either how much they're saving or how much more they're making and you should try to price it as high as possible to still let them have some savings but you should you know right right rightfully so earn some of the profit from that innovation that you have sometimes that may be a hardware as a service model it might be upfront and it really depends on kind of your customer at that point so it's really hard for anyone to try to give advice on that in that front and it's much more around like talking to customers experimenting you could do price experiments know most companies are so small that every time like a new person hears sorry every time they do PR new people who've never heard about it will hear about it for the first time and they won't know what the last price was so you can afford to like do that kind of experimentation especially at the beginning of your company yeah how do you do hiring especially when you're scaling hiring is a mode that the companies in and it's a very distracting mode so I think like the mission of an early stage startup is to get the product market fit and it's definitely not to like hire a team no one gets points for hiring a team or you get a very small number of points for hiring an amazing team you get a lot more points for finding a product that has proper market fit so hiring in general is really like a touchy subject these there's no one size one-size-fits-all there some general advice that I have is what I mentioned before which is higher for trust and higher for reliability over hiring for specific domain knowledge this has really benefited me because right after we kind of hit on Kickstarter we were only two people at the company two full-time people and two interns and so we had like nobody and all of a sudden we needed to hire people and we could have spent you know three to six months hiring a 30 person team and won all these different you know people that we would need hire expert experts that have done it before we could've spent time doing that we would have delayed our initial production by probably three to six months however long it would have taken to hire that team so what I did instead was I just phoned up like some of my best friends from University who had been tangentially involved in the project and said you need to quit your job and just fly here and I think all of them we just hired seven people within three or four days like that and that worked because we had that momentum and we had found product market fit and so they were like that's cool I want to be part of this rocket ship I want to take off but we didn't have to do like three to six months worth of hiring we did three to six days with the hiring and I knew them I trusted them they were instantly part of a team because it was just like we were working on another school project again it seems like the best source pool is either people you met in college or from somewhere else you've had yeah yeah like Pete like too often people overlook like some of they worked at a job with two three years ago one of the coolest psych hacks that you can do is just look through them manually slowly look through your Facebook or LinkedIn and just look at every person's name and think is this person cool and technical and just go through that list and you'll probably find a co-founder you'll probably find a first employee like some long-lost friend from high school that's actually like a super cool developer you could hire her and just bring her onto the team like there's the second step people miss then is actually asking that person and giving a real offer there's always a people do this ambiguous dance of like I don't want you to say no to me and that's so I'm not gonna really ask you and so there's there's a there's a good book called the hard thing about hard things by Ben Horowitz and he talks a lot about like working with friends and the difficulties and benefits of working with friends so I read that book used to end up hiring or working with a bunch of your friends all right [Music] is there a lick question was for some projects problems they can be solved exclusively by software how do you know when to involve hardware in it and when in doubt take all the hardware out does it solve the problem that's the best place to start that's why I was kind of saying like how could you just buy something off the shelf and use it because you may need some hardware you maybe be camera you may need a microphone you may need a compute platform just buy a Raspberry Pi and plunk USB devices into it like don't you don't need to build anything these days some people think like but it's not going to be the right form factor or it's not going to you know do the exact right thing as what I think our customers need just try just reject build something hack something together and see if it at least almost solves the problem because like I was saying more often than not that initial test will prove that either you have a really good problem that really needs to be solved or nobody really has that problem and you don't need to now spend three months working on custom hardware to mr. because the whole user experience make difference so actually we are creating the whole graphic it's not least 182 people but it's really the product is great but middle so it's really bad so what is the best way to pass way so the question was we really complex product an AI psychotherapist or therapist that can that can help people how do we demo that or how do we convey that product to people I would hazard a guess that you know it's kind of a similar question to last one it's like are there ways that we can do this in software rather than hardware so if I were working on a project like that I might start by actually creating the assistant as an app first or maybe like a 3d you know unity character that approximates it that gets similar close to what you want to do or use an off-the-shelf device like hololens or magic leap or something like that we even though it cost way more than you think it's gonna cost from the future you know this is kind of a trick like over spend in the early days like spend more money than you have in order to get that first test done if it's possible if you don't have any money then you can't but if you have a little bit of money like spend that $400 to get like a oculus so that you can simulate the experience in in VR before you actually go and make the hardware from your own revenues and profits and potentially giving so you yeah so I think I mean I would actually go one step above that and understand why hardware companies need financing usually it's for inventory it's rare that a company will need to get funding for it's not rare there's like funding for inventory and there's funding for R&D funding for R&D is like nxu like you need you need that you can either get it through free payments from potential customers that's harder but most people try to raise R&D funding from people at YC or other investors banks will not lend you money for R&D your family might so I would like try to reduce that as much as possible try to spend as little money as possible hacking together prototyping getting to the point where you know what customer at products you're going to build then on the inventory financing side here's the thing that I've learned inventory sucks inventory is like one of the hardest things that our companies have to deal with because they can't make money generally until they have a product that they need to sell it cost money to build that product and it costs time to build that product so you have what's called a cash conversion cycle where you may need to put inputs dollars into your product in order to get outputs down the road again it is impossible it is very difficult to manage inventory so the better thing is actually to rise above it and to get into a situation where you don't need to buy as much inventory so there's two ways that you can do this one is you can get customers to pre-order that's the easiest way is then you have a very perfect idea of how many units you need to build so that you can and you can use that money from pre-orders to actually fund the development you don't need to raise money from VCS you don't need to raise money from banks that doesn't work always but it does work in some crazy situations like Xiaomi up until two or three years ago sold their phones on Tuesday mornings like they had a once that you couldn't go on the website and buy xiaomi phones you could only buy them like Tuesday mornings and so it was like the thing everyone who would be at their computers on Tuesday mornings waiting for like the latest drop Xiaomi phones and they had a really short production cycle not a week but they knew basically based on these prediction based on these Tuesday sales how many units they need to make over the next couple weeks oneplus also did the same thing so that's one way of doing it the pre-order route the other way is to change your product so that it takes a shorter amount of time to build this is called reducing the lead times so the benefit the secret benefit of reducing your lead times is that you have to put less of your hard earned cash into inventory that will then take months to turn into actual revenue so interestingly enough sometimes it's in your best interest to pay more for the product pay more for the bomb but Bill of Materials pay more for the components if the lead times are shorter because you may not actually have a margin problem maybe like you actually have quite a bit of margin free margin but you have this cash flow problem where you can't like fund new batches of products because it takes six months to turn that product into revenue so you could take some of the margin you could do a trade-off where you earn less profit per unit but you're taking less of a risk upfront that's kind of the general learnings that I've had around how didyou Hardware financing great thank you very much Eric thank you [Applause] you
