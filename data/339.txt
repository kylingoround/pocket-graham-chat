now we have cat and with Craig later to talk about PR for content PR and content for growth thanks thank you Jeff hi everyone I'm cat mini Alec I'm a partner at Y Combinator and during my time at YC I've helped hundreds of companies with their launches with their pitches with their initial interactions with press I'm and I'm gonna be joined by Craig cannon who creates a lot of the content for YC and we're going to be giving you a framework for thinking about marketing content marketing and press as an early stage founder so Before we jump in let's define some terms when we talk about content we're talking about anything that you create and distribute on your own channels to attract a specific audience or user so that means anything you make for your blog YouTube podcasts anything that you create and distribute yourself when when we talk about PR or press were referring to an early stage startup pitching an independent third-party publication so that's news blogs anything that's external to your channels so as a founder it's one of your primary job is to tell the story of your startup you'll need to tell that story to investors to press to users to potential employees and you'll need to tell that story throughout the entire lifetime of your company so it's best to start practicing early so you will need to tell it clearly and succinctly because the goal is to tell it in a way where in other people it makes it easy for other people to repeat that story for you and help you spread the word that's how anything becomes viral so making good content lets you shape that story and put it out into the world yourself and then pitching it to press helps you put that story in front of a potentially much larger audience so the combination of the two can be really powerful but making good content and setting up a press practice is a lot of work so you have to decide and hopefully I'll help you make that go through that decision tree whether it's worth doing at the stage where you're at right now am so we will cover we will cover when and why to start thinking about doing content marketing how to think about content like a product and how to measure it how to DIY your own PR and then we'll open it up to questions and so a couple things before we get started first for the majority of you before you focus too much time and energy getting the word out about what you're building make sure that you're making something people want make sure you're focusing on the right things and it all comes back to this writing code and talking to users no amount of press or content marketing is going to help you if you don't have something people want and how do you know that you have something people want you talk to your users and additionally talking to your users will make it easier for you to create better content and do press that will target them and second press is not a scalable user acquisition strategy it can help you get some early inbound it can help get you in front of early adopters but it's not something you can rely on long term for growth it's not something you can really control and it's not even the best way to talk to your earliest users which is why we're gonna talk about content and content marketing first and I will let Craig kick it off here hey everyone I'm Craig I work with cat at YC do the podcasts and all that kind of stuff all right so I before working at YC I worked at a place called the onion we made fake news before it was cool I didn't I did a Photoshop so like putting Joe Biden's head on like fat guys body in front of the White House that kind of thing oh and then after working at the onion I co-founded a company and we made a thing called comedy hack day where developers and comedians work together to make funny apps and then we had these big events Alexus judged a bunch of them and now I work at YC so hopefully that's like the least logical connection of things in this deck so today I'm going to talk about content content marketing some people call it content marketing some people call it editorial some other people call it brand publishing some people call it social content and then some other people call it a word I don't know but like Kat said this is just like basically everything you make so it's gonna be like your podcast YouTube blog video social stuff whatever we can get like more specific and granular about each of those channels if you want to talk one-on-one but this is going to be kind of like broad across-the-board advice that hopefully you can use so the number one question I get is when to start really the thing is just like Kat said and just like Gustav said last week about applying growth tactics you really want to be doing this after you've made something people want and you're confident that they're not churning because if they're churning you're just wasting a ton of energy and a ton of money so assuming you've hit that point you can start thinking about content marketing a lot of people do this in the beginning because they can't afford paid acquisition so the way I think about it is the content as product hopefully you can just apply all the learnings from the delet the lectures earlier on about product and just throw them right at content content so when you think about content is product the only thing you have to change from like the YC advice of makes something people want is make something your customers want you are no longer bounded by nothing you have this very clear market that you're going after and you want to make something that they're interested in I was talking with Wade foster from zapier they do a ton of content marketing it's really good and they write about it on their blog you can check it out oh sweet all right cool thanks man and what he was saying is that in the early days what they were doing was making things that hacker news wanted but it turns out that hacker news and their customers was not a 100% overlap so they were spending all this energy generating this content to get people through the door but those weren't actually the customers that they were looking for so just keep that in mind and so now that you've committed to doing content marketing you're gonna do this what you need to do is pick a goal so there are basically two things that early-stage companies want engagement if you're if you're social company that's like you know Instagram whatever that's like time on site anyone else it's gonna be conversions there's this third thing called brand which is kind of this like vague misty thing about like how people perceive you you really don't need to worry about this early on I mean obviously you don't want to like do evil things and have people hate you but it's much harder to kind of comprehend and work towards so engagement or conversions and now that you're going you want to just set up analytics Suhail talked about this but really it's like super basic stuff the first thing I would do is set up mix panel not Google Analytics but something similar to mix panel will get the job done you're just tracking where people are coming in what they're doing what they're clicking on how long they're on their site all that stuff and then the next thing you want to do is install a Facebook pixel again this might not be super valuable to you in the beginning but a lot of YC companies launch without a Facebook pixel and what this is gonna do is capture who's hitting your site who's logged into Facebook so then you can later remark it at them and this is gonna be much cheaper than any other kind of Facebook audience that you can create so you want to do this because if you launch on Hacker News and have like 10,000 people hit your site and you don't have it installed you won't know who it is afterward all right so the next most common question I get is what platform this one's actually not that difficult you just want to find your customers so you just talk to them be like where do you hang out do you hang out on reddit Instagram whatever you can look at your referred data but this is really all you have to do because your objective is to find people like them and and then once you're hanging out there long enough you're gonna be able to figure out what does well they're so for instance like essays like Paul Graham's essays they do well in hacker news makeup tutorials do well on YouTube vlogging all that kind of stuff because you're gonna be wanna be you're gonna want to make the stuff that does well on those platforms this is for two reasons distribution is really hard even for huge companies a lot of companies would just rely on paid acquisitions you know like boosted posts on Facebook that kind of thing and you have no money and so assuming these two things are true you have to figure out where your customers are and you have to figure out what does well they're two examples so scent bird they're YC company they do a perfume and like makeup subscription box they do Instagram influencer marketing you can read all about this online they've blogged about it a bunch another example is YC so YC although PG and Jessica Robert and Trevor might not say this has been doing like content marketing since the very beginning even before so with Paul's essays and then hacker news was built and then those essays do really well and that's the exact kind of audience that would create a startup they just kind of like rinse and repeat alright so now that you found out where you're gonna go in like generally what you want to be making I think um not enough people spend enough time brainstorming it sounds kind of silly but most content because people don't spend enough time brainstorming ends up being derivative of all like the average of all the other stuff people see so it doesn't stand out and it looks like all the other stuff because you've got the ideas from the other people whose blogs are reading or your competitors whatever and my example of this is going back to the onion so the onions been around for like thirty thirty years maybe more at this point and they've had hundreds of people work there this is how the onion picks headlines and I think it's particularly important because it's allowed them to create consistently good stuff with a lot of different people over a long period of time so the way the onion picks headlines is they have say 10 10 writers each writer is responsible for 10 to 15 headlines a week and then they email those headlines to an editor the editor removes everyone's name and then they just pick their favorite as a group and so the objective is to have like only 5 to 10 percent roughly survive and so what this is really good at is first of all it removes biases for like who's the CEO who's the new guy or whatever or girl whatever and it also gets you past the point of the like those first 3 ideas which are kind of the same from everyone this is like a huge problem and if you go on like just any average company blog they're all writing about the same stuff so it's a huge mistake I think the onion got it right there's a This American Life episode about it if you want to learn more and that's how you get this this is one of my favorite ever is before my time but it's so good oh man all right can we just stay here for the rest of its no just kidding all right so now you want to make something good again this is like dumb stuff that should be self-evident but I don't I don't know it doesn't seem to be based on the internet what does that mean so that means dedicating real time so to break down what I talked about before maybe that's like an hour a week or every two weeks brainstorming and then it could take you a whole day it could take you two days it could take you three days to write a blog post and you know maybe in the early days you can't do that but you should let that amount of time dictate how often you can put stuff out rather than go the other way and be like I have to get a thing out every week and then you write a post in ten minutes and it's garbage and so you're just wasting your time you also want to dedicate good people doesn't have to say that you're hiring bad people but what it's saying is that you want to dedicate the people who have actual domain expertise and can lend something that's in wresting to the rest of the world you know that means usually like a co-founder lead developer that kind of thing just two other little things from the media world you need to be prepared to edit all the time like just really be precise about your language because people don't spend that much time on your site or your video or whatever and you need to be prepared to kill a lot of your work and that really sucks but you have to do it you know like I said at the onion like most headlines by definition would not make it through I think for a company that's really hard to do but you know you can easily kill 25% of your stuff and so this is I want to illustrate why this is important most people think that they're competing with people that make the same stuff that they make that is 100% not true you are competing with this Elon Musk smoking weed on Joe Rogan's podcast I haven't checked the views but I think it's probably like 10 million now and this is like a 2 or 3 hour podcast this is the internet you're competing with this guy you're competing with porn you're competing with everything else on the internet and once you like really let that sink into your brain you will have the motivation to make something that's both valuable and engaging man that was a good podcast - all right so then the next thing this is the part that's really hard for me is promotion so promotion is both incredibly boring and totally necessary this means like sharing articles out over and over on your Twitter feed figuring out new different creative ways to do it a lot of people will tell you to make a version for each platform you can do this but again you're gonna be optimizing for one place where your customers are you know YC it's so like now like I clip up the podcasts and like put it on Instagram and that's cool but like we're still getting way more podcast downloads than we are getting like Instagram views and that's just how it goes not everything's gonna work everywhere I'm putting this slide in here twice because if I were watching this talk this would be the thing that I'd be like oh yeah man I got it don't worry about it and then I would skip over it and then I would have played myself because I'm dumb and lazy and I would not promote it enough and ice-t is awesome all right so just really quickly I'm gonna rip through a couple examples so Gustav talk talked about this one last week SEO Airbnb you made a bunch of CD guides so these are both super useful they get you on the site you can hit someone with a face Facebook pixel you can get your brand in there and then you can convert like this is such a dream for them influencer sent bird influencer marketing if you google just those two words you'll read a bunch of blog post about that customer profiles so zapier who I mentioned earlier they help non-technical people work with api's by doing all these integrations for them what's particularly cool about this is that they are always finding new and creative ways to link stuff together the customers want to talk about themselves and they do it over text text interviews are like a total cheat code for young companies because they require way less production than video or audio the internet really likes it for like SEO for scraping and it makes the person look really smart we've done some of these at YC you time over time like the person wants to promote it more than they do then when they see themselves in a video and they feel weird so that's an easy thing to do industry advice is another great one so triple bite helps companies hire engineers intercom is that little like chat widget you've probably seen before desk trainer at intercom writes about product and content marketing those are great essays triple bite hard who used to be at YC writes about hiring engineers these are all great posts with the one caveat being that you have to really know what you're talking about or this just won't ring true next thing tools front this is a YC company they made a website called good email copy or something like that or Matilda just like pulled together her favorite lines from emails and then tagged things so like onboarding we're shutting the company down like all kinds of like fairly templated emails and you can go on there and check them all out so if you have like extra engineering time these can be super effective community so both hacker news and product hunt we're kind of like built out from from YC entities but just getting good at engaging with your community on HN in product ton is really undervalued if you're someone who's like known as like a good actor on these sites and like engages with people and is cool that's worth your time not saying just like lurk and comment on everything but you just know how it works if that's where your customers are and then the last thing and this is like not exhaustive at all but these are just like some examples publishing so stripe is now making books 37signals Basecamp they make books too this is super powerful in terms of like your influencer status but really really hard to track so this would be later down later down the road but it is effective and because it's hard most people aren't going to do it so you can really stand out and that's it so cats going to come up to talk about press [Applause] all right so let's jump back into press so why as I mentioned it's not a scalable user acquisition but it can get you some early adopting users it can give you you know your investors or potential employees a heads up that you exist and it can help with SEO so a lot of people ask when do when should I start to thinking about press so ideally you will have a sense that you're making something people want as we said so for most startups it's worth waiting to pitch until there's a call to action for your intended audience so is there a product that they can try or buy or something they can sign up for so most companies who go through YC wait until they have a launched product and some very early users before they bother pitching to press there are some exceptions so there are companies that do press pre product if there's something particularly novel about the or notable about the company this is especially true if you're working on a bio company or something in the hard sciences that will take you a long time before you get to product and there are other companies that wait years before they do press and so one thing to note is that most media outlets don't cover very early stage startups anymore so you shouldn't waste their time with a non-story um think about what you're pitching objectively why should they care about this and why now and so you know that's one reason why a lot of startups will the first time they pitch press will be to announce a fundraising round because that's timely news and that's why you see a lot of those fundraising announcements it's just an opportunity a timely opportunity to pitch so so we'll talk about I'll go through a checklist of things that you should prepare when you are pitching press and the mechanics of how to do it but a first a quick word on PR firms don't hire them at the stage that you're at PR firms are way too expensive typically you have to keep them on a monthly retainer and you know most companies even through seed series a they don't have the budget for that so the thing is that your relationships that you build now would press will hopefully similar to investors last throughout the entire lifecycle of your company so you want to do that work early you shouldn't bother thinking about hiring a firm or someone in-house until you have more funding and so much inbound that the founders can't deal with it themselves and so one thing that you know PR people so so PR people you know a lot of people think oh if I hire someone to do PR they'll magically think of all the most interesting stories that I can pitch well that's not the case the most interesting stories are going to come from you the founders you know your company better than anyone else and so what PR firms do have is connections to reporters but you can build those yourself and here's how we think about it we treat PR like business development so like BD or sales which you wouldn't outsource early in your company's life you shouldn't outsource pitching to press in the very early stages of your company as I said like these are relationships that you should build now and we'll hopefully have for years to come and so when you think about you know how to do this we can talk about what you need to do to DIY your own PR essentially so we will walk through that now so um a couple things that I recommend any company do is and people ask me how much time should I be spending on this so here's some recommended prep work I think you can spend at least thirty minutes per week reading about the news in your industry keep a list of publications that cover your space a list of media outlets that your users read and a list of specific reporters are interested in your vertical so if you don't know which outlets to track or to read talk to your users and ask them what they read and what they're interested in then I think that if you decide you want to try pitching to press I think about it in three to six increments of time so you can build a calendar you can spend half an hour once a month thinking about what milestones are coming up that you're gonna hit what announcements you might have and map them out so here's an example using a startup school company in this batch they're called or B or B is building flying robots that help retail with inventory tracking and surveillance so for example in January assuming you know they raise a seed fund they might want to announce their seed fund rated C seed fundraising with the you know intended audience of being engineers then in March for example they may want to pitch a trend data story a retinue targeted at CTOs that talks about how AI is lifting up brick-and-mortar retail sales so you know it's just good to kind of do these brainstorming exercises similar to what Craig talked about in the content space for potential stories that you can pitch externally to press so once you've decided you want a pitch a story and the first thing to do is to define your goals and your audience that will help you determine everything else who you want to pitch you know this exact story you want to pitch and how to measure its success and so once you know who your audience is you have to draft three things a one-sentence pitch a three to five sentence pitch and answers to frequently asked questions so questions that are frequently asked by reporters to early stage startups so let's dig into each one of these things so one sentence pitch should go over two things what you're building and who you're building it for and you should be able to say this in jargon free terms that anyone can understand and repeat so here are a couple examples of startup school companies who I think had pretty strong one-sentence pitches coming in so or be who I mentioned before flying robots that help businesses monitor inventory and do surveillance it's so clear and straightforward that I remembered it you know just off the top of my head when I was describing them earlier you want anyone to be able to do that for your company the second one is another startup school company the box company they're building smart eco-friendly box says for food delivery so you know what they're building and who they're building it for for both of these examples and for probably all of your companies a one-sentence pitch isn't going to capture everything that you're doing but you don't have to communicate that in the one sentence pitch just make it really clear and compelling enough that people follow up with with questions and you know you want them to ask you you know questions that will let you give them more context so next is the three sentence pitch with a three to five sentence pitch you can give us that that context you can give us more of the story you should talk not only about what your company does and who the customer is but why it's better than what's currently in the market and then also if there's anything really notable that the founders or the story or the market make sure to put that in there so usually when we are pitching companies at YC when we are pitching to press about their launches or fundraising this is the pitch that we send to reporters so let's go through two examples for or B and the Box company so or B is building flying robots that help businesses monitor inventory and do surveillance the robots were designed with safety in mind and are outfitted with light weight vision sensors that let them navigate autonomously alongside retail or warehouse employees or we can save employees hours of manual will work per shift so they can spend more time doing things that matter like serving and helping customers the company is currently in pilot talks with major US retailers so we covered what they do you know who they're building it for and why they're better than what's currently in the market when I talk to the or B founders they said you know what makes us special is that these are very lightweight and they're very safe so that they can fly around indoors you know alongside humans and really help them you know we also tease the fact that they are in talks with big retailers and so that's something that might pique someone's interest a reporter's interest second is the box company they're building smart eco-friendly boxes for food delivery and then you can talk a little bit about the market the food delivery market is on the rise it's predicted to grow 79% by 2020 and then you can talk about the problem but it's still difficult to order food to order delivery and get the same quality would get in a restaurant additionally packaging is often non recyclable and non compostable which creates an enormous waste problem so then you talk about their solution the box company is solving these issues with a patented box that improves the entire delivery process and you could talk a little bit about the units that they're stackable easy to assemble they solve this soggy sloppy food problem and you know then if you have specific you know if so say they have a customer they want to might want to put that in talk a little bit about their progress but here again you have a little bit more context you can show how big of a problem it is and how they're solving it so now you have this I think it's best to for you and your co-founders to draft the answers to frequently asked questions that reporters ask so I talked to many reporters and one of them sent me this list and while she was at Laura kolodny while she was at the Wall Street Journal she said these are the questions that I asked all earliest age startups and expect them to know how to answer and so you know I won't go through every single one of these now but you can take a photo of it or reference it later but these are so it's best to draft really succinct answers to these and one piece of advice I have is that it's great to practice it's great to practice your succinct answers but I wouldn't over a hearse because you don't want to sound like a marketing robot with everything memorized you don't wanna have these memorize answers that you use in every context so what I typically tell founders to do is have answers to all those questions and then what I recommend doing before talking to press is bullet pointing the three to five points that you want to make sure to talk about in an interview and then let the rest of the answers to questions sort of flow organically so it's good to practice but don't over rehearse so let's talk now about how to pitch to press like what the mechanics are now that you've done this prep work now that you're ready I will dig into each one of these so picking your moment the big question is why now you know TechCrunch back when they first started covered pretty much every single company that launched because they were like you know one startup every two weeks would launch and in the early 2000s but now they get tens if not hundreds of pitches per day so you have to think about you know what's your news hook like you know if you have news like a fundraising round that sort of makes it easy or if you can show that you're part of a trend or current news story that might be you know what makes it easier for you to get a response I'm so the example for or B they can say you know or B we're a flying robot company and we're giving brick and mortar retails a fighting chance against Amazon so everyone's talking about you know it's all retail against Amazon these days so if you can plug yourself into a trend piece like that that make it makes it easier so another thing to think about around timing is that if there's a big news event happening that week don't pitch your story so if you're you know reaching out to TechCrunch during TechCrunch Disrupt you'd be crazy lucky to get a response from them or if you're pitching a reporter who covers Apple don't hit them up during WWDC like your chances of getting a response to decrease immensely and so now after you are picking your moment you have your news hook you know what you want to pitch you can pitch your target target and this is easy because you think through who is your audience what are my goals think about what they read I would stack rank a list of your top three choices so have you know these are the three publications that I would most like to cover my news and be realistic realistically the New York Times isn't going to cover a newly-born company and as much as I would love them to and so I would you know look at who is actually covering startups at your stage and in your vertical and add those as your you know your first three choices and so then basically I would recommend giving an exclusive to your first choice so an exclusive is one you pitch your story to just one reporter and if they agree to pick it up you don't give anyone else a briefing or a heads up until that reporter you know publishes their story and a lot of people ask why an exclusive versus giving you know kind of a lot of different reporters a heads up on the news so the reason is a reporter is more likely to pick up your story and write it if they get an exclusive if they can break the break the news if they can get that scoop so I recommend offering that one publication at exclusive and once you're a bigger company and more of a household name or your bigger you know say fundraising Series A plus news or huge hires then you can think more about briefing multiple reporters at once but early stage for the vast majority of YC companies in any one pre YC I always recommend exclusives first and so now that you know you know who your target is that you want to offer them an exclusive how do you get in touch with that reporter and so the best way to get in touch with reporters is through warm introductions just like business development right the best way to get an answer from someone is to get a personal introduction to that person to that reporter and so cold emailing will get you maybe if you're lucky a one in ten response and warm introductions will get you know at least half the time you'll get someone to respond to you so you know what I would do is create that stack rank list here are the top three you know choices of reporters you'd want to reach out to if I were or B for example I might want to hit up Laura kolodny at CNBC she covers drones and flying industrial robots and so you know she I would then ask my network you know everyone I know on Facebook any other founders I know would you be willing to get does anyone know laura has she covered anyone in my network and would you be willing to give me a warm introduction and so YC founders often ask each other for introductions to press and so that's for them the easiest way and often and so assuming you find that person to give you an intro make it as easy as possible for them to introduce you so I would draft the email for them you this is what a draft email might look like they should be no longer than this anything longer than you know two short paragraphs a reporter or anyone really their eyes will glaze over so I'm draft that warm in you know intro email for your friend and and you know hopefully you have a better chance of getting a response from that reporter and then finally I would say give it time I often get requests from founders saying like oh can you help me out I need this to be done tomorrow I want to launch on Wednesday and that just isn't going to happen so ideally you know work your way back say you want to announce something two or three weeks from now give it at the very least two weeks for the whole process of warm introductions and making you know a you know meeting with that reporter and then having the piece come out so two weeks is the absolute minimum time I would give it and then sort of you know what things you know what not to do once you're in touch for the reporter and some of these sound pretty obvious and I I don't believe any of you would ever do these things one is don't lie don't fudge your numbers don't say you can do things that you can't you know as we've seen some you know very public instances in the press of things like that happening those stories will always come back and haunt you I've seen it time and again ii don't have like you're entitled to a story so if you get in touch with reporter feel free to you know follow up if they kind of go silent follow up once or twice very politely but don't sort of you know I've seen some founders you follow up every single day for weeks and it just that's crazy don't do that because then that reporter will write you off and you won't have that relationship long term don't suggest headlines or copy this is the reporter's job to do and you know they see it can they can be a I've seen people get offended by founders suggesting specific headlines and then don't ask to see a draft I've we've worked with a lot of folks that come from the life sciences and bio and they're surprised by this one they're used to peer-reviewed journals and but the thing is reporters get incredibly offended they think you're questioning their journalistic integrity if you ask to see what they're writing before they publish it so don't ask to see a draft I mean there are certain cases where sometimes they need to fact-check some things so they'll show you something ahead of time but let them make that ask of you and as I mentioned don't speak like a marketing robot just you know talk like a human know know your numbers know the answers to the questions but don't worry about having everything super memorized and so if everything goes well and you know you have a piece that is published as Craig says don't be lazy take the time to promote it you have you know social media channels promoted on all your own channels and if you have an email list of investors or friends you know shoot them a note saying hey good news we were in TechCrunch and you I would draft a tweet for them and when folks trim you know draft tweets for me to send out and much more likely to just copy and paste and you know help them promote it so promote the story you know don't be afraid to ask friends and family put it on all the socials and then Plan B if they you know if it turns out no one wants to run your story it's not a big deal it's not gonna make or break you so post it on your own channels and put it through the whole content process you know I think it's it's a reasonably good practice to do that and then think about after you go through this whole process was it worth it did it help did the piece that came out in TechCrunch or Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg actually help you achieve the goal that you set for it did you get new users on your platform did you get potential investors you know inbound and did it actually help you achieve what you said it what you set out to achieve and so that is the entire process and we'll just open it up to Q&A if anyone has any questions Craig you want to come back up here all right if journalists are already reaching you and you don't find market they'd never be focus on product at the moment it should each spend any time in meeting with them or to just like focus on the cockpit so the question if if journalists are proactively reaching out to you and are interested in writing about you but you don't have to really early and don't have product market fit what can you like should you spend any time engaging them you know frankly I you know it can you know it does helped us have that relationship and if there's a way you can be helpful you're like reasonably quickly or like oh you have a question about this you know vertical or this industry I'm happy to answer but I wouldn't then spend a huge amount of time pitching your story but you say like I'd love to keep you posted on our progress and then check in with them regular regularly or when you have news but I think it is good to be helpful early on what are you gonna write about oh right yeah sorry if you are just starting out in content marketing you're debating whether to do a personal blog or a company blog my question to you would be are you writing just about company stuff okay so one thing that's really effective is doing it like title of blog by so-and-so like you see this with a lot of podcasts it's like whatever the podcast name I mean like Joe Rogan is like a good example but that's not a company thing people connect with other humans and so you like having that little extra touch is nice but I would say overall like you're gonna want it on your own site for SEO yeah I like I kind of disagree with people putting stuff on medium and so early on yeah I've seen it works really well when you have like a company blogging stripe has their company blog but then they have specific authors for each blog post but and people really like connecting with that human how do you feel about working with influencers who don't necessarily or don't have a need for your product at the top like our company is based around moving so like if influencer is not currently moving how do you feel about working with them it's a promotion the question is how do you feel about working with influencers who don't need your product at the time I I haven't seen cases like that that have worked out really well especially for earliest agent I think a big problem is that influencers often charge you and are expensive like if you get some huge influencer who just loves what you're doing and wants to tweet about you and that's great but but more often than not they're gonna charge you and it's not worth the conversions not going to be worth it especially if they're just you know generally talking about you versus answering a real need for themselves but but this is totally something you can test I like but kind of like what Katz saying like I wouldn't bet the farm on something like this be like oh man for $100,000 we can get in on this thing like I would skip that but I mean like at scale it ends up working like I heard Casey Neistat this vlogger is responsible for an insane amount of boosted board sales and I'm pretty sure they don't pay him anything so it does work I've seen folks I'm often you know if you know folks with hardware or like physical product will send you know samples or demo pieces to press or influencers and that's sometimes enough like Casey nice that loves boosted boards so he sort of organically talks about it and that's great but but having to pay those influencers is not usually worth it early on [Music] with the three to five centons examples that you for me and company how much it that is what they're actually doing today versus what they want to be growing pork like so we're not buzzing how do you draw that balance so the question is with the three to five sentence example how much of it is vision for the future and what they you know hope to do and versus what they're doing today and so I think it's I think you can sort of there is a fine line as you said I think it's possible to communicate both you know you can say this is the vision you know and today they're doing X and so you know four or be in or B's case I think they have prototypes they have pieces that you know can do that theoretically but like they or at this point when they would be pitching but you know they can say they could add a line in there about if there is a bigger vision for the company that they hope to achieve you can definitely drop it in there but I think it's best for people to know where you're at right now um this is on some Greg I think the clickbait versus authenticity I'm one so that example of Elon Musk's is great because they're my mercy on my smoked weed but there was really awesome stuff in their podcast and I was authentic but how do you we've got a lot of great content but it's really sort of expert level and we sort of at that level of what do we want to do some catchy titles cuz that's gonna bring in the audience what's your view on this hash we balance this yeah because you can't give the audience II do not have some sort of headline right so I would say so the question is like make clickbait you the assumption is like we have a good content we're not getting a lot of traffic we're debating whether like to title it something straight or give it some clickbait headline hopefully get people in right right so I'm generally not for that the thing that bothers me more than clickbait headlines are really shitty stock photos like I think that that's like a red flag more than anything on a blog so definitely skip those this is something you can test but kind of back to that zapier point like if you know where your customers are and like know what they really want you should be able to title it in a way that will get them to respond if you're going for like giant mass appeal you might have to do that but like I've never I've never had success doing like clickbait stuff and in getting like good results yeah I mean depends on what the product is that's the objective right like it's not it's not quick made technically yeah the question is like should you make a good headliner shitty headline you should make a good headline [Music] during the product marketing the early stage open to the father's publish content every how often should public founders publish content during the phase we are trying to hit product market fit still before our product market fit that's tough I mean as you were saying that it does take time to create good content so I don't want to say you should do something every week because then that's putting you know that might be unrealistic for a team of two right but I mean I would say like if you can make something actually good every month you're doing great and I mean I think a lot of it takes companies a good amount of time to really find product market fit so you can start earlier than you know prior to hitting a product market fit it's uh it's all relative to also like the amount of value that you give with the piece so like a lot of these like decks like the mary meeker deck that happens once a year and then tons of people like millions of people will download this thing but if you're gonna like just right you know a four paragraph blog post you probably have to publish a little bit more frequently you know I mean [Music] you don't have right oh yeah so if you don't have product market fit she did not write anything I mean it can be helpful to build your own brand but I think yeah in general like like I said in the talk you're just funneling traffic so the question is if you have a celebrity that's really gung-ho about your product and wants to boost and talk about it what are the potential downsides Oh like you know like if the alt right or something decides in what you know that's happen right so it's like I mean there are definite downsides I don't think that it's not something I would worry too much about I think the vast majority of companies don't have this problem I mean it's it's sort of like but yeah I think he's in general it's a good problem if you if you have like people were so excited about what you're building I mean if in the case of I think it was New Balance or something where you know the alt-right was like we love New Balance you know New Balance had to come out and say you know you know we don't endorse you know what when what they're saying and so I think you know you have but but this is such an uncommon problem that that I don't think you have to worry about it early on and also like I agree 100% with cat but if you're getting a celebrity on board just because they are inflammatory like if you thought Alex Jones was like the best representation of your brand and like you weren't prepared for the show that was gonna come like that's kind of on you you know [Music] series of obsessor just curious I mean how often should we send updates or should we send updates technically um you know for the vast majority no once sorry oh yes repeating the question should be how often should you send updates to reporters about your product and the progress that you're making so I would say that they don't generally want to hear every you know update you have about your product or you know that kind of progress if you have news they certainly want to hear that if there's something you want announced and even you know I would give them the chance to say no that they're not interested it's it's worth it if you have news reaching out there are some cases you know that where you know for example why see at this point because we've been around a while you know a lot of reporters ask to be added to our email list or a press list and in in those cases you know you can send out you can send things out more regularly but I wouldn't sort of blast reporters every month with with your company updates let me give you let me give this to you hi so what I've learned over the years is one journalist live on Twitter so that's the perfect place I mean if you're building your product you should look at which journalists which publication you want to cover you later and Twitter is the right place for you to engage with them and you know they're super responsive it works amazingly well apart from that there's this tool called Herald which is helper reporter it's just that's where journalists send out if they're writing a story and they need help and it could be anything from biotech to scene learning to healthcare to anything and they send out these um emails about you know what they're looking for so if that's your passion if you're an expert in any of any of those things you can just you don't have to pitch your product you can just say okay you know I'm an expert in XYZ this is what I think about this topic and that reporter is going to be grateful and you can build relationships like that so it's good advice all right thank you thank you so much and
