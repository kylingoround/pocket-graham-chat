today I am honored to have my good friend Aileen Lee here and we're going to have a conversation about stuff yeah well I hope we talk about like alien is is is a very public personality in the in the venture world so there's lots of great talk she has given online and I hope not to do too much of that with she she tells a lot of amazing things so it'll be hard to avoid but so this would just be the the latest version of pearls of wisdom from alien but hopefully we'll try to push the conversation in other areas if we can so how about a welcome for Aileen Lee welcome to startup school thank you I'm happy to be here so you they might not know that much about your kind of interesting and I was the idiosyncratic career that led you to being the founder of of cowboy ventures maybe we can just start with you giving a quick overview of your background I don't know from the gap to to now we're definitely going to do a QA and like your time schedule is actually they can stay because because the one of the reasons we're doing this at YC now instead of at Stanford is that Stanford you're like constrained or not this is our building so usually we talk for 30 or 40 minutes and then do a QA whatever's natural so do you have a hard stop at all I can't remember but okay probably okay okay okay hi everyone thanks so much for spending time here I'm really appreciative I'm a lean it's like I am a first-generation immigrant my parents are both from China so I'm a very like I grew up in a very traditional like our family had nothing we they saved up money to buy Chinese restaurant people in the family worked in the Chinese restaurant like and I grew up in New Jersey so you grew up with entrepreneurs kind of yeah I mean I guess I guess I mean I think immigrants are entrepreneurs right because you come here with nothing and you have to figure out how to get a job and how to find a place to live and how to make it work and yeah like I think there's a phrase a kleiner we used to say like an entre definition of an entrepreneur is like who does more than anyone thought possible with less than anyone thought possible and I think that's probably true for entrepreneurs for immigrants as well I bet that resonates with a lot of people in the audio and but I was fortunate that like my parents were very focused on education so I wanted going to MIT being in completely over my head and then I did a mess of banking for a couple years I guess the idiosyncrasy I lived in China for a year and taught English and studied Chinese I went to business school and at business school I was always really interested in brands and in particular consumer brands and how they generate a lot of working at customer love and so I cut it and this is like kind of pre-internet so I used to go to the library and read Fast Company and ink magazine to try and find names of companies that were kind of up-and-coming and I would then look them up in the phone book and just so quick now I went to the library how many people have gone to the library like read magazines yeah like five that's how we did it back then or you could look up and you could look up older magazines on something called microfiche raise your hand if you know what microfiche is oh cool and so I found a company called Odwalla and a company called The North Face and they're both out here and so I called like I would just call the phone number and just ask to talk to whoever would talk to me and I convinced them to hire me for the summer so I did like two months that wanted to month and they're both kind of private I guess that now they would because their growth companies and I did marketing and then after business school I went to gap and you know my family was not that into me going to work for Gap you know he was and all this time trying to get a good education maybe retail is not the place to go but I feel really passionate about like I was gonna have the opportunity work with really smart people in Gap at the time was such like a talent magnet in retail like some I think the smartest planners and merchants and visual designers and we're working at the company and we were just kind of on fire and so I spent three years working different operating rules like I worked on the supply chain projects trying to figure out where stuff was it's called glass pipeline and then I got a job I worked as chief of staff to the CEO for a year kind of just doing everything from helping prepare for public company board meetings to making sure they'd hit a good parking space when we went to go on store visits and and then my last job there was the online store in 1999 and our online store was just we were Capcom was the only thing we had we weren't sure if we were going to Old Navy or Banana Republic calm because we weren't sure if this dot-com thing was going to stick and turned out yeah yeah exactly I think you and I have been working for you know 20-something years since then we should have just bought Amazon stock just like chilled yeah you mean you didn't I did suggest at one point that that well I was at Yahoo that we buy Amazon I went and what happened they think that was a smart idea they no they said they said the you know would screw up our multiple yeah yes I worked with Friendster right yeah and there was this little startup called Facebook yeah and I remember talking to them about maybe I think they wanted 20 million and we wanted to make 15 stories so anyways I was helping run the dot-com part of gap in 1999 and it was exciting but also just not a pure play tech company and so much was happening in the.com boom so I just said you know I think I should go work at a tech company and so I sent my resume whoever would read it and I wound up getting an interview at this from kleiner perkins and they I think they thought it would be novel to hire a woman your gender is what and and also that I had been chief of staff to the CEO I think was kind of like a good con training for to be an associated venture firm so I went up working for a partner there named John doar for four or five years and we just super hit it off and John is a legend in venture capital and we were working with like Google and Amazon and just we had incredible relationships and and got to meet incredible people and I was also like the the dumping ground of every business plan that was sent to kleiner perkins at the time and so every night I would just take home duffel bags of printed business plans and read them and it was an amazing experience and I it was like a two to three year job there oftentimes at venture firms it's very opaque in terms of is like there is not really a career path and that was not a career path job but I wound up staying for 13 years but you stayed for 13 years but there was a gap in the middle where you became a CEO I always felt like I didn't have enough operating experience especially not I hadn't been a venture backed CEO and I think you know a lot of this may be old school thinking but that kleiner the thought was like you know it's really hard to give advice to a start-up CEO if you haven't done it yourself and if you know haven't run the functions you haven't lived through the experience you haven't really put yourself on the line and so an opportunity came up where a company that we had invested in and I was on the board of was had two co-founders and not neither of them was clearly the CEO and they asked me to come in and help and I was really excited to have the opportunity to work with them and to get some more operating spirit so I spent I took kind of two years off from kleiner and I went and ran this company it was a digital media company it was like kind of an ad sales driven business in the digital life out of home space at the time there's a company in China called focus media that had like an eight or nine billion dollar market cap taking kind of what had been paper billboards and turning them into digital and running basically like kind of a content management system and kind of like an ad network for for digital billboards and that's what we were trying to build at RMG's I want to be CEO at the time kind of it was it was a great experience and we we thought we had our model locked and loaded in O seven so we raised a twenty million dollar series B which at the time in O seven was a big B and notes like a day yeah exactly now it's like a seed joke but I have seen seeds that large right and then you know eight happened and we went of having to lay off half the company but then we also like because we had this nice with a lot we can we kind of anticipated winter was coming and we kept our powder dry so we were able to live through it we went acquiring two of our closest competitors and then I replaced myself with like a better CEO and I went back to kleiner so it was a I was I felt really fortunate Akito is hard though really so do you feel that you were right and that that experience did help you give better advice to CEOs and and what so it might be hard looking back now but what what did you learn as CEO that informs the advice you give now I mean I had never I guess many things one is I'm kind of a people person I love talking to people and I saw I thought that would naturally translate into being a great manager and I had managed some people at Gap but not a ton but I think it's very different being a CEO or a leader where people you have to first convince them to work there you know work at your company and I turned out to be not as good at this as I thought but we have different reports like you have a head of engineering a head of marketing a head of sales a head of financing they often have different personalities and you want them to have different personalities and they have different strengths but that means they often if they managed in different ways like you have to communicate with them in different ways and kind of like figure out what is the style of communication and rhythm and like what's the what are the words that are going to help them do their best you have to modulate it by person at least that's what I found and I that had not been intuitive to me I thought you could just be yourself and everything I don't know if you know I I had a mentor of mine who used to call that touch and I think one of the things that's interesting as a start-up founder like most of the folks in start-up school are struggling to find product market fit yeah and they're thinking about that and I thinking about that and at some point they sometimes they lose track of the fact that really especially if for example they talked to an investor like you you're evaluating that but you're also looking at this person and wondering could you hire a VP of Marketing a VP of Sales a VP of engineering can you can you attract the right people can do you have do you have what it takes to be a leader as a founder and I think people sometimes as you're struggling just to get a customer you lose track of actually what it takes to really grow up that's absolutely right which is and I'm sure we'll talk about that which is like what are investors thinking like we're thinking about short term and long term when we talk to you like we're thinking about whether you can accomplish the short term but also what comes after that and what comes after that and whether you are demonstrating that you can parallel path in a way they thinking about how the short-term is a setup for the long-term effect the reality is the only thing that matters to investors is the future the present is only an indication of what the future may just look like because they're betting on your future yep exactly the other thing I'd say I guess many things about being a startup CEO like I had never hired salespeople before I didn't know how to create a compensation structure for salespeople or you know I'm like how do you create on it like sometimes when you do that your comp you create unintended consequences by how you compensate people I found like I hired these you know different kinds of sometimes experienced people sometimes inexperienced people like you know what kind of how do you want to place bets on people who are unproven versus pay up for people who are somewhat proven but sometimes they come out of platforms where the platform was doing really well it's not really clear that the person was really good so I learned a lot of lessons around that and also just in sales in general and I'm sure many of you who are trying to get product market fit experiences like sialic lead qualification is really important like you yourself and your sales team can deceive yourself into thinking that making progress by having a lot of meetings but the reality is a lot of those leads are never gonna close and so figuring out like what how should you spend your time and how do you qualify leads so that you're really spending time on the accounts that are a good fit for you and are actually good closeable in the time and the money that you have is something that I have learned the hard way well that's a good luck I was thinking about that yesterday because I was talking to a founder who whose company was betting on a deal closing and and that deal just didn't close and we were talking about it and the problem was that they didn't really have that bad a problem like the problem he was solving it was a problem and they were there was a few people who kind of interested in solving it but it wasn't a real heart problem and those are the wrong customers to spend a lot of time with and if you don't figure that out early yeah and even if you close them if it's not sustainable yeah like then you just live kind of campaign a campaign or quarter-to-quarter and you can't like that your turn is gonna be high you're not gonna build up sell the people so you kind of like like you were saying about short term plus long term like it's it's hard enough just to close them but you have to be able to like close that same person maybe with more money every quarter and if you think you're gonna be able to close them but they're not going to come back sometimes it's not even worth closing them he's like all that stuff that I had never done before that I learned well Tyler Bosnia Bosman II from from clever is coming to talk about sales next week so that's the yeah perfect setup that so I think we should talk a lot about a lot more about what investors are are looking for but but I've been thinking you've talked a lot about that before and and said a lot of amazing things but I was thinking a little bit about from startup founders perspective how how they should look at investors and what they should look at I was thinking about you and one of the things I thought was somewhat different about you was the level of empathy you bring to the the founders who come to you and that investors you know but I think it's different I think that it that there's a there's a level of help you give which is not just you know here's how you should think about sales but here's how you should you think about believing in your business do you think about things that way is that is that part of your calculus I mean you you do so much more than just as an investor and you you're interested in in in a broad set of ways that the ecosystems put together and I think that all is part of the same picture I don't I don't know if I I don't know if it's I think it comes naturally hopefully and I mean my partner Ted who you know his was thinking about writing this blog post about making venture capital human and it's like when we were writing and it's just the fact that you have to think it's so dumb to write that that we decided not to write it but because he's relatively new to our firm he's been a cowboy for a year and a half but he's been working with startups for 20 years and he said that that's one of things that he noticed joining Cowboys like that we are more maybe empathetic or more human that a lot of VCs that he knows but it just has so dumb to be like hey come to us we're human that we didn't we didn't do it if you're sure the others are but they're a is masquerading his people yeah interesting a company I mean I think I'm a person who a lot of people may look at my resume or what I'm doing now and think like wow she really has it together like I have not had it together for much of my life I have screwed up projects I have failed at things I have been the person on the business school project who's a procrastinator and like doesn't show up with her homework done when everyone else is ready I'm the person I have been the person who's like slid into class like slightly hungover being like hey Jeff did you have notes I did not read this case and this is all public by the way I understood I believe people can change I believe people evolve I believe people learn and you like you have to give people second chances and you have to like believe that they're going to get better over time like I just think in general to be a venture investor you have to be an optimist but like also because like you know I was a Series A Series B investor when I was at Kleiner and I moved to seed and so kind of by definition deciding to go earlier means you want to live with people and situations that are more raw and that less is baked less is figured out and that you're not trying to poke holes and what could go wrong but you're trying to work with the people and figure out what what do we need to go right and that's like just what we what we do right in working with you know folks prior to product market fit or you know half the time at cowboy we the people haven't built a product yet and half the time they have so kind of by definition it's what we choose to do but it's also just I feel like I'm a product of people who believed in me like you know John doar and the people at Kleiner changed my life when they hired me I was the first woman I was the youngest I did not I was never a working engineer I wasn't working at a venture back startup I was a completely non traditional hire and I wouldn't be sitting here if people hadn't made a bet on me as a non-traditional hire it's interesting when I think about John the first word that pops in my head and it might you know I'm Way better than me so it might be different is thoughtful I was thinking of like what what are the characteristics of the great investors I know and thoughtful and empathetic like those like and you don't often hear those you think about people who like who get your product who are familiar with labor sales are invested in similar companies and like your your domain but but if you think about it the people who I think if we look at the industry who are the best at it have those qualities and not just the cold hard qualities that that make for like you know investing magic you know I I don't know if I totally agree like I think John and I used to do this presentation called like there are mercenaries and missionaries and that one doesn't always win like you can win if you're a mercenary and you can win as a missionary you just have to choose what you want to be and I think that there are plenty of people in tech who are pretty mercenary like they're pretty cold they're very driven they just care about results and they push and they push and they're super aggressive and you can win doing I mean I think I'm guessing in your head you're thinking about brands of companies in your mind that seem like missionary companies or mercenary companies right and there are successful companies that are more mercenary than missionary so I don't think it's completely there are people who we know were not worm and you know don't ask you you know how you know how your spouse is doing or your sick mom or you know or and but and those people can be successful it's just you have to choose who you want to be yeah maybe there's a connection between them which is you should you know we always tell this to founders is usually look for investor who's going to be most helpful to you and sometimes having your butt kicked is what you need and sometimes having someone you know understand and understand what you're going through and hope you still believe in your future is what you need and I guess it depends really is the answer yeah and you're gonna both I think like you can that's what you should look for yeah I think we you know we all we have a saying at cowboy we're always happy never satisfied and so it's a you know we're very grateful and we were like positive and optimistic but you can always do better so fundraising is premature for some of these folks but even if it's premature if you're a startup you're moving fast and it'll happen it'll it'll become relevant soon for folks who are just in the middle as I was saying battling for customers and to figure out what their as we say at YC you know talking to customers in writing code and talking to customers and running code and trying to trying to find something that works and solve real problems how should they start to think about fundraising how do you how do you think about that like what's what are your first steps as you as you approach that stage so I think something that we have talked about here at YC and it's funny because it's a relatively new thing to talk about I think it's always been there but now we have an articulation of it which is storytelling you know some people are naturally natural storytellers and some are not I think regardless of whether you are a natural storyteller or not it's really helpful to become one for fundraising there are you know people want to be emotionally engaged in your story and the journey of your company and like and and the arc and to feel like your company is on an upward arc and so how you lay out kind of how you came up with the idea you know what work you did to figure out whether there was a they're there to validate or de-risk some of the initial potential issues with your company like I know how you've hustled like in a way it's like a lag story like you're engaging someone on the beginning steps of a rags to riches story and like showing people what you've figured out and like what challenges you faced but like and where you see it going is part of how because that's a story telling is selling you need to woo people who can get paid much more working at Google or Facebook right it's how you recruit talent it's how you convince customers to take a bet on you when you don't have a lot of other customers right it's how you convince people to pay like movement to the paid like to the paid version from the free version you know it's how you raise money and so it's a skill that that you can use in pretty much everything that you do and it just takes practice like I think there of people like I used to be super nervous speaking on stage and for the first couple years I worked in venture when I got invited to anything to speak I said no so Stu scared you just have to do it a lot and so practicing your pitch getting feedback from friendlies like we call them like puff off Broadway's you know like you probably don't want to give your pitch for the first time to that partner that you know what Sequoyah you want to practice it you know and you want them to register on your mind yeah on your coat with your co-founders with other people who raise money and practice taking questions from them way before you have to start fundraising like you don't want to you know if you have to start fundraising in December you don't want to start your pitch in December right you want to start your pitch over the summer and practice it and get lots of feedback and I mean YC is great at providing that kind of feedback as well yeah I don't think you can stress enough that aspect of practicing your pitch in a in a way that you take feedback and learn and iterate it's it's almost like like writing code and talking to customers like they're your customers anyone who will listen to your pitch and writing code is going back and modifying that pitch because it probably won't work the first time you do it they might not but you might even ask them did you even get it at the end and they'll say I have no idea what you're talking about so that aspect of practicing in and perfecting the pitch is critical right I think so how else to think about fundraising I mean Jeff mentioned it before that you know when you have a milestone that's right in front of you like I want to raise my seed I want to raise my a you're very focused on that but like Jeff mentioned the people who have especially if you're gonna go for institutionally back dollars whether it's a seed fund or a larger venture firm like when we take money from professional investors we are have to basically guarantor kind of to be a top quartile fund we have to deliver a certain kind of return top quartile returns for more recent ventures like vintages or let's say for a 4x return right so if someone has a hundred million dollar fund they have to figure out how to generate four hundred million dollars to be kids like to be able to raise money in the future and so that 400 million dollars is going to be a combination let's say of 30 different companies two to four of which are gonna wind up being great and the rest of which are going to wind up not being so great and so to kind of balance out the averages the two to four that have to be great have to be really great like they have to worth a billion dollars or more especially when you move to a like for a seed fund if we are able to get the right owner like you know our first one was forty million dollars so if we owned 10% at exit of a four hundred million our company we could return our fund but those kinds of like that kind of aperture for an exit really stops at seed like once you raise a the people need the exits to be much bigger because those people all have five hundred million dollar eight hundred million dollar funds so they need to own 10% of an eight billion dollar company to be able to return the fund and so and the data shows historically that most funds don't wind up having 50 percent of the company's all the four hundred million dollar exits there they have two to three B multi-billion and a bunch of zeros or near zeros and so they're looking at you thinking is this one of the bullets I'm gonna fire this year to be one of those companies that's going to be my outsized winner they're not thinking can I get this to two hundred million or 300 building and they're thinking can this founder turn this into a multi-billion dollar company and so the short-term execution and story has to be right but sorry for institutional folks that's what's going on in their minds yeah it seems like a lot of founders going to the process not understanding like if all those numbers that that a lien was just talking about sort of you're sort of thinking whatever whatever it's actually vital that you understand venture capitalists math so that you understand what the motivations of the person sitting across the table from you are why they're asking how big is your business going to be and why they care and why although you might be thrilled to have a 30 or 40 million dollar exit might sound pretty good right you own 50% of a 30 million that's fantastic for a venture capitalist that's like a failure and it's important it's more to do their math because if you want them to give you money you better understand their math and I think I mean it's not the answer for everyone right like a lot of people can be successful and get to a 40 million dollar exit with a party round of angels and that has happened now I think the downside and I guess I'm a little biased is a lot of times just having angels and not having anyone who's a professional investor like they may not give you the guidance that you need on how to scale your company on what's going on in the market on you know what could be going wrong or right because they're you know they're not professionals they are high net-worth individuals who are gonna write your check and say keep me posted and move on so I think you know sometimes you have to do what you have to do but that's always you have to do it yeah exactly yes exactly you know ideally you have choices right and and a lot of what I think as you think about sequencing your fundraising and building your team is like basically like trying to continually put yourself in a position where you have good choices right and certainly if that's the only round you ever raise which by the way is philosophically how you should think about it but if you do want to continue to be a fast growth company and raise a Series A and seriously having institutional's who can help you find the partners for the next round it's pretty important one of the things that that also occurs to me that people don't often talk about when it comes to fundraising is a lot of founders forget that that that you have to do all these things yourself like when you started cowboy you had to raise money you had to go to the professional investors and tell your story what like how is that you know it's humbling fundraising is humbling so it's humbling because especially when I started cowboy I was just me and so basically you know any meeting that I had it was clearly a verdict on whether they believed in me or not now it's good that I went through that because it and any everybody who fund raises is gonna get some nose like eventually someone's gonna say no to you even if you're like the hottest company ever or like some people are gonna pass and but that gives me a little extra motivation to make them really sorry like I want them to really regret not investing in cowboy ventures so it's good yeah yeah I think that not enough investors go through that experience I think part of the problem is is that at some point if you've been there for a while it's the you get these funds that just investing again again you don't have to suffer the way a startup owner has to suffer and I say suffer because it's very unusual when you raise money not to get nose right like you should get used to it like and also just like all the things you said when I was raising the fun for the first time I got a lot of smiles and a lot of like this is great this is great I'm totally gonna follow up send me a link to the data room and then I would know they were not checking the data room and when I would check in with them they're like this is great investment partners gonna love this and then they would come back and say they would either ghost me or they would come back and say I'm so sorry I super thought we were gonna get this through but we didn't and I just wish those people had not wasted my time and so it does give us a lot of empathy and me a lot of empathy for like following up you know if you send me your business plan or we have a conversation I try really hard to get back to you and tell you if it's not a fit for us now why and not just smile and kind of like gfu so that a lot of people knows are hard right they're hard to get a lot of VCs I think are afraid of telling you why they're really passing because they're you know if you do well they want to be able to call you later and pretend that like they were just really busy when I passed or you know and they're your best friend you know yeah like how I just said about like making you really saw if I'm not investing they don't want to be that person so they don't tell you why they're really passing but doesn't really help you so and I also think again in fundraising getting back to what we talked about lead qualification so when I did my first fund raise I was I had gotten some advice from some other folks who were really helpful like Steve Anderson and Mike maples and and people who had Michael Deering who had raised funds as a solo general partner before me and they said the original super angels right exactly they they said like looking no certain types of investors are gonna smile and it's their job to learn about what you're doing and so they'll meet with you over and over again they're not going to they're not going to come into your first fund they're too conservative so be careful and so I decided to create a process or I tried to create a process where iPhone screen everybody before I met with them and if they hadn't reinvested in a seed fund before and if they didn't know who first round was or Harrison metal and didn't have a feeling like I had missed that or I have now kind of I've got a budget to make sure I don't miss the next wave of seed funds then I just I said it'd be great to keep in touch but let's not meet let's not meet and so that it kind of made the sales process a little bit more efficient trying to really qualify leads before spending time with them so I've never asked you this but did you find that that being a female and trying to raise from LPS for a venture fund colored the process in some way did you feel look did you feel yes that you were treated differently yes and sometimes it worked out and sometimes it didn't so I'm sure it's just we know there are lots of studies to show that women and men have more confidence in men right like a woman can say the exact same thing as a man and it will not come across and give the same impression as Amanda's right and so I could give a great pitch and people would some people probably came way as thinking like I just don't know if she's enough of a killer um I don't know like she has kids what if she wakes up one day and decide she wants to spend time with them like you know who knows what they say but probably all those things and you know it would be really great if people said that about men - I don't think we're gonna hold our breath but you know I think it just you know we are we're all unfortunately biased and I mean is this an asymmetry that's built into the genders because we are different or is it something that we can I'm hoping we can work on it like there's a study I think it's like a pen MIT study where there was a PowerPoint deck and a voiceover talk track and they showed it to I think hundreds or thousands of business school students and they gave the Business School students like you know you have a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars to invest in this company how much do you give it and they had in the different classes they a be tested they showed the slides on the screen and they had a woman speaking of it like doing the voice-over or a man the man raised 2x the woman same script so we have to I mean we have to believe that this is changeable we have to address it at every stage of a person's life whether you're an elementary school or junior high or adulthood to try and catch ourselves on our biases and yeah thing that gives me that's it back the thing that gave me pause there as you said it's - for women yeah and women and men's the female and male students both gave the man more money so we got to work on it but yeah so I'm sure there were people who just you know and and meanwhile at the same time they're a bunch of really bro II guys with not as good track records and probably more like polarizing reference checks who raised money really fast because people were like he's such a good guy I love that guy he goes out all the time like everyone's gonna want to hang out with him and give him deal flow because he's such a great guy and like some of those guys don't work in our business anymore cuz it turns out that they're not really ethical guys and they don't treat people professionally but they raised a lot of money but I think the great thing about our environment right now is we talk about it you know to five or ten years ago we did not we just pretended this stuff was not happening and you were kind of unique when you started there were so few women in the industry when you started it and I was kind of taught like as much as I love my former colleagues like it was very clear I should never talk about being a woman and I mean like that was just at the time was like you know keep your head down don't don't cause problems cuz then no one will want to hang out with you yeah and we shouldn't do that to people and yeah I know you've been active in thinking about about inclusion not just not not just loss genderless but diversity as well you start all raised or maybe you can give a quick for that as long as we're here sure so all raised is a non-profit to try and accelerate success for women in the tech ecosystem so founders employees venture investors but we hope it will create a rising tide for all kinds of people who are different not just women and we're just starting out to focus on women so all raised org is the website we started lots of things we're like a little startup we're a nonprofit startup that's all volunteer driven right now if you have heard of something called founders for change and the new one heard of founders for change raise your hand if you've heard a founder changer so if you are a founder you can go to founders for change org and you can sign up to be a founder for change which basically says you're going to publicly make a commitment to inclusion and diversity on your team on you know when you have choices on your team on your board and on your cap table and you know it's not binding you don't design assign anything but you're just standing up and saying I care about this and standing up and saying I care about this is gonna say sling to the people who are potentially going to recruit and to the culture that you're going to build which I think will make your company stronger we do office hours for female founders and we have a matching service to try and help women and people of color who want to get into the venture business to kind of help get them trained and then also match them with firms who are looking to add more diversity to their teams so we have like a lot of cool products yeah the cool thing about entrepreneurship is you create seeds and so like entire communities can change because someone someone starts a company and shows that it's possible we're talking about belief yeah that how important belief is and you you can inject we hope and believe belief into a community anywhere right anywhere in the well it's a cool thing about startup school is a thousands of companies from around the world that can they can change the world that is amazing so before we go to Q&A You've I'll put you on the spot a little bit hopefully you can remember how you did this but youto like you give a really great description of what the components of a pitch should be and I want to yeah I'm on it like the and you're really good at that and and that's a really concrete thing that we talked about telling stories but it's not just any story it's a story that has components that matter because because as we talked about venture math the there's there's there's a math component there's a results component so maybe maybe you can help these folks if I talk if I don't do a good job of this hopefully if there is a talk there's a logic yeah so I do think that there are like us on some fundament like fundamental elements that should be in generally all pitches so I I do like it when people start out with the team slide and they talk about who they are and why they started the company and ideally why you have a certain background or certain things that you've done that make you the right founders or the right people to be solving this problem then you talk about the problem you know why is it a problem and then you talk about how big it is and investors are usually looking for problems that are billions of dollars so if the a and then you know and not just the overall market the addressable market so you know if you know if a market in real estate is you know five billion dollars but you can only get Timbers on the market your addressable market is only two to five hundred million and that's often too small for venture investors so they really want your addressable market to be at least let's say five or ten billion because they want to know that if you are really successful and you get tempers on the market that you could be making at least hundreds of millions of dollars so then you talk about your product or your solution right which is like this is you know this is what we've built to solve the problem here's how it works and ideally you talk a little bit about what's special about it what's your unique insight what's the technology you develop that's again that makes it so different and oftentimes it has to be like a 10x difference like a 1 to 2x difference is not enough it's hard to get people to try new things and so there has to be a real significant benefit to get someone to switch from what they're doing to try something new and you might talk about the competitive landscape and there people are looking for your your honesty and your transparency you know some founders tend to hand-wave competition like oh they all suck and they're all stupid like that's you know that doesn't show that you're gonna be nested like honest about what's going on and that there are other people who are already out there doing what you're doing or have like that other people currently use or that other people have certain features that you don't have yet because investors and board members don't want to have to haircut what you're saying when you're talking about how the business is going they want to know that you guys that you can be honest and transparent with each other about the reality of what's happening then you might have a financial plan and talk about and oftentimes like a three-year plan is a good thing it doesn't have to be by month but kind of like maybe what you're going to get done by month in the next 12 months and then what the annual revenue in revenues or what the PNL looks like and what investors are looking for is both the top-line in terms of the revenue numbers and the revenue growth the margins of the business and that costs that go into the business and both the gross margin and also like how much you're planning on spending on marketing how much of the money is going to go to technology development and people versus buying ads and things like that and then how much cash you're planning on consuming over the next three years that's pretty much it that helped yeah that's awesome I was going to say in the financial plan some of that depends on how far along you are how involved you are you might have a CAC and you might not but you ought to have some idea how you're gonna make money like you ought to be able to describe why it's a business as opposed to some service that people might want but might not pay for when they end up deny things good to have like a summary slide like you know if you've ever taken public speaking or a presentation class they'll tell you like I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna tell you and then I'm gonna tell you and then I'm gonna tell you what I told you so Kunsan has this slide deck can be that too or you start out with a summary slide like you know here's here the highlights of what we do and then you go into the whole thing and then you say and again here are the highlights so um before we take Q&A there's I'm sure you're so sick of talking about unicorns and that like to have some sides having them so so so Aileen is famous because or infamous I don't know for inventing the term hated unicorn and I just had like I had a question why unicorn we're not like dragon or like why is it an animal why isn't it like a diamond Dora where did that come from Mike maples from flood floodgate of any of you he's such a good he's like King storyteller and he used to call big like you know big winner company is thunder dragons which is super perfect so dragon was taken a thunder dragon was taken I wrote I wrote the analysis so basically I had this new fund and I was you know that the lore had been it's you know out of 30 companies who wanted having two winners and a bunch of not-so-great companies and so I had asked LPS for the data so I was just trying to figure out like is that really true and if I could basically a great the data of other people's funds to understand what like get what had what was the composition of their winders you know where did the founders come from how did they know each other what birth order were they like all these questions of you know if you have a clean you know of a clean dance card and there's a kajillion seed stage companies out there are there any things that the most successful companies in the past decade have had in common that I should know to be looking for and I could not I had such a hard time collecting the data so I wind up to starting a spreadsheet and making a list of companies that had been born within the past ten years that were worth over a billion dollars and I just started like making a list of where they went to college how many co-founders there were when they were born how like you know so therefore how old were they when they founded the company had they worked in tech before like it just had a thousand columns and how much you know - they sent that I could learn how much they raised at the a at the B what was the time period between the rounds like all the things to see what they had in common and so I kind of rode up my and I there were a bunch of things that I think were a little bit contrarian at the time like mo the most successful founders of the prior decade were in their 30s when they started and you know the the conventional wisdom was like you have to drop out of college and start when you're 20 and I had been meeting with founders who were kind of apologetic when we met they're like I'm so sorry I'm 32 I know I'm really old and I was like no don't don't apologize like you have work experience that's actually important which is interesting because if you look at the earlier stage like the first stages adventure everyone will everyone starting enterprise companies and they were all like to start an enterprise companies you need to know something about enterprises they were all in their 30s 40s and 50s yeah and that was one of the differences in the annales that consumer founders tended to be younger than Enterprise founders when they founded the companies because yeah exactly what you said so so there are a bunch of things in the analysis like like the vast majority of companies had co-founders and there's a reason why I like being a solo founder is hard really um being a co founders really had exactly and also they were people who had had contacts like they had lived together or work together a gun to college so it was like very rare that you that you meet a co-founder on a blind date and that that I mean this holes dataset of 39 companies early they're all outliers so it's not like it's there's no statistical significance so these are all just examples or stories of kind of the making of but I thought that there was some useful things so I wrote this analysis up of like what are the things I've learned from this analysis and then I was yeah I had this phrase of like you know public or private companies less than ten years old that have become worth over a billion dollars that I had written over and over again in the piece and it was just so hard hard to read so I was like I got to come up with a shorter word is it home run is it mega hit is like what and they it just all sad so lame let's go catch oh yeah that's it and then I I put in unicorn and it made it so much easier just popped into your hook yeah well I was thinking like you know the thing is that it is almost like alchemy like you could do all the right things and have the right background and try super hard for ten years and this could and it might not happen for you because it just it really is quite rare out of thousands of thousands of companies being born every year in getting funding only thirty nine at the time and still even now if the number is 100 or 120 whatever then or is it still like out of all the companies that are born every year a very very small fraction so the idea was kind of like it is like magic and also I wanted it to feel special and magical not kind of laboratory clinical somehow it just and it immediately caught on one of those means dead took off yeah so thank you thank you questions for operations product of marketing so what's the distribution of funds proper distribution of funds during a from a seed round what kind of a company a I powered it's mostly probably going to be team and technology right you're probably not going to have you're probably not gonna want to spend a lot of money on customer acquisition right you're going to want to build something where the tech is so unique and so attractive that you don't have to spend money to acquire customer so I would think that it's largely gonna be team probably yeah yeah yeah like the cost and distribution of funds is hard because soft from feelings answer it depends so much on what kind of company most most software companies spend almost all their funds on people hardware companies a little bit different yeah back there so how do you look at non-traditional founders and how do they go about showing you that they they too can be founders of unicorns I guess III add at that last part but I think that's what he meant yeah I mean I think like what we were talking before about the story and how you explain like you know how you came across the problem that you're trying to solve what your personal passion is for it and what you've figured out like a lot at seed there's not a lot of data right a lot you haven't maybe shipped your product you don't have customers there's no cohorts but what you can talk about is your hustle right your insight when you've hit roadblocks what you figure it what was your workaround and what you figured out that's really what a lot of seed stage investors are looking at is you know do you have that grit and like the right skill set to figure out and so seed in the space I mean I think it's a better time than ever to be a non-traditional founder I friend Ally Rosenthal who's raising a fund right now and her focus is going to be non-obvious founders you know it's it's like this was not a thing a decade ago but now I think both we realized that you know investors have probably just been hunting in too much of the same pool over and over again companies don't need to be based in the barrier anymore Richard Kirby did a great analysis showing that like the diversity aventure is a huge problem not just in terms of gender and race but the majority of people who work in venture went to Stanford and Harvard there's just no way that that's the right answer right you know it just missed opportunity yes tons and so I think it's a great time to be a non-traditional founder so how did if you meet lots of VCS how do you choose them less based on just gut intuition and more on some sort of rational basis so I would recommend on both we do reference checks on both sides like when we're thinking about investing in a company we try and do reference checks not so much like criminal background checks but more understanding you where you work before what your strengths are how you need to be complimented what you've experienced and the same thing founders should feel comfortable if you you know when you have choices it's it's hard it's very hard to get divorced from your investors and so you should reference check investors agree just investment in company in they did a lot of so the question is has to do with raising on a convertible with a cab if you raise 250 thousand and can you vary that cap across different investors I mean I think the cap question has a lot to do with the market right and what choices you have so you know I wouldn't take the first offer that you have and it'll assess it with a dilution right I'm thinking about what dilution you're willing to live with knowing that this is probably going to but not going to be the only dilution you're gonna see right and so you know you a good rule of thumb is generally you have to imagine that in every round like your seed round or a round and then it's decreasing at B and C you're probably gonna sell between twenty and thirty percent of your company over time so you think about like how much money realistically you may have to raise over how many rounds looking at companies in your space how many rounds like most people think that they should only have to raise through B and then they wind up raising through F I think it just happens that waiver is a reason and so you think about you know you want it you want to get the capital and not have to spend too much time fundraising but also you don't want to experience too much dilution my personal opinion is the different caps is a really bad idea if there's a gap if there's a time gap between when you raise that's all right but otherwise all you're likely to do is to have a bunch of pissed-off investors which as Ian says you're gonna live with for a long time and that's never a healthy relationship you are really getting married to your to your investors that you you're creating a long-term relationship so I'll it seldom starts on a positive foot to find out that the person you talk to 15 minutes before got a better deal than you did yeah you thanks a lot for that today I mean you mentioned that used to call the VCS and the firm's when you were early on but today I think it's all about getting the reference right reference times you know we see so sorry in donors who came out of not work there not from us oh they're from outside this area they don't have height preference so what is your recommendation for temp to reach out to the PCs how do you reach out to VCS what's the recommendation you know or get a warm intro if you're not from from the from the area and you don't or you're not from Stanford or Harvard right I think it's both you know I think a lot of especially seed firms take cold intros all the time we take cold end pounds all the time and a lot of it depends on what you say in the email about what the market is that you're going after what you figured out so far we meet with people all the time that just emailed us a traditional VC was you yet you just received a whole bunch of business but no one knew the VCS they were sitting off on Sand Hill Road no one knew them exactly and they got business plans so yeah it still exists so but I do think it's helpful because I think it's a you know figuring out how to get a warm intro in some ways I think is a test of your hustle and your ability to network and build relationships when you especially are from the outside so I think that's one of the reasons why people use it as a filter it's like you know if you're not good at figuring out how to like start from you know a cold like a stop and then like to get some momentum then you know maybe you're not gonna be a great entrepreneur so I would try both yeah I think one one thing to think about is that like it's a pretty small world here everyone knows everyone Saul I got to do it like to find someone who's connected to alien like like elbow three people and you'll find somebody so it's it's not as hard as you might think maybe someone from [Music] and happy thoughts about that and why that is so the question is on a study that found that women the companies founded by women are evaluated 84% less than I guess male founders I'm not sure if they normalized over industries yeah I haven't read that study I I mean I think a lot of the studies the if you look at the Unicorn list right now right there's only like two female founders in the whole list right so if you're doing an average across venture yes of course like those companies are the vast majority of the kind of paper wealth that's been driven in the past decade in the industry and if there's no female co-founders or you know that that own the equity of or and these are the most valuable companies in our industry then yeah it's that would make sense and I think even if you just if you looked at it like kind of apples to apples across seed my guess is the analysis will find that and parsley for some of the reasons that we talked about that women founded companies tend to be underestimated by investors partially due to bias but women also can I think we can you know we can work on it on the Investor side to try and take away some of the bias and then we can also work out on the founder side kind of helping and coaching women on how to tell stories and how to pitch like I'm fortunate to have worked with some women who have raised a lot of money at very healthy valuations and in very competitive situations where they've been multiple bidders and the price like you know the multiples relative to revenue or run rate or like you know what they figure it out have been you know quite high a lot of times it comes to the story like what both what the founders have figured out and how they tell the story so I'm sorry we were going to take one more question because time is flown in the back [Music] so the question is when you're analyzing the factors that went in the various characteristics of unicorns were there any factors that surprised you was that surprised that we're surprising that actually mattered oh that did Matt well which factors did not matter that was it that were surprised oh that's a good question I don't know if I have a good quick answer for you on that one just because I focus so much I'm like where they were signal I don't even know if I remember the things that it didn't have signal okay we'll take one more question then right there you only get one you have to pick one pick the best one so they're looking for especially with the curry optional distribution and I'm coming at it from I have no idea how to concisely say that a question it's something about aligning objectives where where where is I don't know I don't know if I get it yeah can you can you try to make your put your question in like a very concise short one sentence understandable format so the test investor who's seeking a higher return how do you align your objectives with enabling a lot of companies that are looking for the lowest cost to market in terms of so how do you balance the high return that investors are looking for with companies that need to very to compete in a very price-sensitive market is that right I think they're aligned I mean we have you know your investors have the same goals right which is we want to help you get to market so we can quickly get feedback on whether there's a dare there on the product right and so helping you figure out like what are the things that you look what's your Minimum Viable Product one of the things that are nice to have versus need to have like for example oftentimes when we hear a steed pitch someone will be like well I need all this money cuz I have to build both Android and iPhone and we'll say like well we don't have any market validation yet why would we build both let's just spend money on one of them see if people like it and then we'll build the other one right so like those are examples I think what they're very aligned in that we work together to figure out how do we get our product out there and get feedback and kind of conserve our cash that we don't blow it all before we have actually learned anything it all comes to the same thing okay sorry to cut it off guys thanks very much thank you so much thanks for coming [Applause] you
