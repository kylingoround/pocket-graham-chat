today is Thursday which usually means that adora or myself sit up here with someone notable and have a hopefully interesting conversation the someone notable we have today is Andy Bromberg my friend and the president of coin list the president and co-founder of coin list which is this really fascinating company that is doing some interesting things will talk about but Andy maybe we can start by you talking a little bit about your your entrepreneurial background because interestingly even though you graduated from Stanford a couple years ago coin list isn't your first venture is it that's right so first of all thank you for having me and thank you everyone for coming this is gonna be a lot of fun the entrepreneurial background for me started even before school in high school it's one of the people that started some web design and marketing businesses nothing really notable but I think it was really valuable to get that initial experience of building something and hiring a team and managing a team and firing people and figuring out how to how did you do all those things while you were in high school I did yeah I got started was a lot of fun what what made you do that at like what was it about being an entrepreneur and that that attracted you while you're still in high school got in high school I was I was worried about other things it was really nothing about being an entrepreneur and more about not wanting to do other jobs that I was able to do when I was in high school you know you can sit there and you can do whatever sir pizza or scoop ice cream or whatever it is I worked in a supermarket yeah that was awesome I did the scooping ice cream too yeah it was fun but I was looking at it and saying like all these businesses in my town have awful websites and I've got a bunch of friends that do this stuff in their spare time and that seems like just a way better way to make a little bit of money while I'm in high school then you know circle pizza and so I went and did that and expanded out videos marketing photos all that stuff ran a few websites that did pretty well but it was really less of I want to be an entrepreneur and more of I really don't want to do these other jobs and it then developed into a love for building things from the ground up and trying to create but at the time it was it was purely an alternative nada not a primary so did you so you really weren't thinking of this as like I'm an entrepreneur and I'm gonna be like my family's been entrepreneurs forever it was more an escape an alternate route from sort of the normal high school I'm gonna get some some maybe not so interesting job and do something more interesting and probably you made a lot more money doing it too yeah absolutely and I think and not to fall into some of the the immediate kind of startup cliches but I was doing stuff that I really enjoyed doing I was hanging out with my friends and building things which was really fun I enjoyed that we built a bunch of websites around just things that we liked and it wasn't necessarily that we're looking at it and saying you know I'm gonna analyze this opportunity and do my Tam calculation and figure out this and the business strategy we just said I love playing soccer what if I made a website that reviewed soccer cleats alright let's do that we made one of those did really well what you know I like messed around with computers let's build one around you know how to how to dig into the internals of a Mac and do things with it let's build that that's it pretty well it was really based on these things that we just enjoyed doing we had figured out how to do and want it to build these sites around our passions I'm intrigued so this was going pretty well you're you're probably senior in high school you um get into a little school on the west coast did you ever have the thought like I'm not going to Stanford I'm gonna just I'm gonna like I am the next whatever Mark Zuckerberg I'm going yeah I don't I think those really truly would have been kind of delusions of grandeur at that point they were these were like little things they were fun and they made money and I you know covered my expenses and was able to do what I wanted to do but it was not none of these were going to be massive businesses and sure of course the thought occurs you're like I could just keep doing this I'm surviving on this this would be fun but ultimately I got a great opportunity to go to a go to great school and decided to do that and continue to do them for a little while while I was there and did some of that stuff but kind of trailed off during a couple years I was there and and and then eventually kind of tailed off completely well but the idea of starting companies didn't because apparently the bug hit you again while you were at Stanford right yeah that's right so so I was I was there for a couple years had a lot of fun really actually the most impactful bit there was tied into this whole entrepreneurship thing which is I took this amazing class when I was there I'm called startup engineering from a guy named Paul DS furnivall son who's now the the CTO of coin basin formerly see over and calm and formally a partner andreessen horowitz and founder of counsel amazing guy who actually lectured at the very first ever startup school and and he taught this class about you know I think a lot of times university classes aren't on entrepreneurship don't teach you the real skills you need to start a business he might teach you some really high level things or really basic fundamentals but nothing around the the pragmatic steps and he set out to build a class much like this one that said know if you're actually going to do this what you need to do there's a lot of time with guest lecturers coming to classes a lot of time with you know things like it was a computer science class how do you deploy code how do you you know do revision control on code and how do you put on github and how do you do these different things the practical pieces and we took this class a bunch of us and had an amazing time and actually out of that which will come full circle back to this a small set of folks that were in that class ended up founding the Stanford Bitcoin group back in 2012-2013 I hope they bought some Bitcoin not enough ever enough but yeah so he convinced us all you know this Bitcoin thing is gonna be real at the time we're looking at him and saying no way I mean this is 2012 were like this Bitcoin is magic Internet money I don't believe you for a second this doesn't work and and he said come on let's do it and so we started the stand for Bitcoin group and spent a couple years in school doing a lot of Awesome research and evangelism and had a lot of fun running around you know teaching people about crypto and building things or researching things but then yeah ultimately I did end up leaving to start start a different company and left even that behind well so that different company was side wire which interestingly seems like it's more relevant today maybe more than Bitcoin because it was all about like real news right yeah so I built this platform called side wire and I I left school in 2014 to start this company and I left early because I found what I think is the perfect partner for it my co-founder Tucker good background in politics and I had this background in computer science building things we came together to this product that was a platform where the experts in politics could chat publicly about the news of the day and everyone else could read and engage but not participate on that same level we wanted to build a Twitter without the noise what if you took just the experts and put them in conversation with each other and we did this really around the 2016 election there was 2014 - we ended up winding it down last year 2017 but it sounds like we need it really badly I think we still do it you know I talked to a lot of people that are building similar products trying to separate out the signal from the noise and hopefully some of you in here or online are working to do that - because I think it's such a critical problem turns out very hard problem a variety of reasons but I think it's it's critical that someone solve it so maybe for the benefit of these folks and never fear we will we will talk about crypto TED talk a little bit if you would about the process of starting the company you left school to do it and and and the winding down like what happened and and and maybe if there's some lessons learned in there from that experience yeah absolutely the starting was was really it always is kind of the best part when you have this germ of an idea and you're trying to turn it into something and so we started Tucker and I met and started talking were introduced by a mutual friend named Adam well I was still in school we started talking about this concept that there's this crazy noise level in the discourse today especially on politics and other topics we separate that out with a lot of different ideas around how to do it and iterate it through a million different things and and ultimately he was working at that time a great job I was in school we're looking at it as I'm sure many people are saying and this is a big leap to take to go from very comfortable situations out a couple years left school he was again doing great at work you could make this leap and so we said all right we have a we got to a place where you know nine months in a kind of casual discussion so we're both working and learning we said we think we know what we want to do here and the timing was I mean was great we're looking at this this is right before summer 2014 so we know I've got some lead time up into the elections to build stuff and then launch into the election cycle we thought we knew what we wanted to build and so we said alright well we need to get some validation for this before we get going which was just the the state of mind that we were and I don't think this is always true for entrepreneurs by any means but our state was you know we're both in great positions this is gonna be really hard let's get some validation so we went out said we're gonna raise some money and if we can successfully raise that money let's go and do it and the the commitment kind of was that if we could do that before the summer I would go obviously over my summer and working at full time and then beyond and he would leave the job and go and and and we do it together and so we're able to put together that money and get that validation and start building did you race from angels then yeah almost entirely from angels yeah and we had an amazing set of investors lesson learned and thankfully we didn't learn it in the negative way having great investors is such a boon throughout the business and things run well and when things are on poorly we'll get to the wine town but even that part having an amazing set of investors that were aligned with us cared about us as people and you know we're support of what we were doing was so critical at that point and really digging it on on what their motivations were was was really important see we raise from a lot of people we had I forget the exact number now but something like 44 investors in our seed round or something like that ever think that maybe that was too many yes and no the only time I ever genuinely I never really want to turn down money right yeah the only time I genuinely thought that was too many was when I was dealing with meeting all of them to sign things but but generally again it goes back to the quality of the investors they were supportive and not annoying and never nagged us and we sent out our monthly updates and you know made sure they were informed and it was never a problem it was just yeah sending out 44 Dawn's a lot of DocuSign son send out but imagine one one issue with like 40 or 50 or 60 investors is that even if you really try to only get high quality investors the probability that one or two of those are difficult gets pretty high yeah absolutely and of course even within that set of 44 there was a spectrum of people ranging from absolutely perfect to slightly less perfect but but on the whole it was a really great set and we're fortunate to be by them and so we ended up doing that and and the the short story on the company is we've built for about a year and then we kind of raised the last part of that round it was all one big round but raised last part of that round from spark capital who were amazing investors highly recommend working with them and they kind of completed our institutional seed round and then we launched the product and ran it for a couple years and ultimately wound it down last summer yeah 22:17 mid-2017 I think from a product perspective just just just before you get there yeah so you went all the way through the 2016 presidential cycle did you guys have any insight more than the rest of us about what was going to happen in November 2016 based on yeah the discussions that we're taking place I can say and things I can't say but the yeah what you know we're talking to a lot of things you can't say exactly there's there's a lot of smart people out there and and this ties in to what side water was able to do but also kind of who we were talking to you we got the this amazing set of experts in the platform engaging like crazy but a thousand people senators presidential candidates reporters analysts staffers all the people you would want to have talking the really smart voices the smart commentators having these amazing discussions going back and forth firing back and forth being entertaining and and and we felt like that side it's a marketplace right you'd supply of content and demand content no one is paying but you know supply and demand we crush the supply and just no matter what we did we couldn't get people to pay attention to it which we thought was so interesting so our thesis going in and I think a lot of times startups about having a thesis and testing it but a thesis we felt really strongly about it wasn't so far as build and they will come but we thought this is a marketplace a two sided marketplace if we can get the supply if we can get smart people to have smart conversations about the news of the day then we will be able to get people that show up to stick around and keep engaging with those conversations and reading them no matter what we didn't there's no way to know what the issue was we could not get people to come and stick around and you know people would show up and read one conversation and then would not come back and I think it the day what we felt like was you know in that space people it's hard to get people to care about the smart conversations it's not people say that's what they're looking for and and it might not actually be what drives them and what they actually want they want 140 or 280 characters of sensational tweets yeah yeah and and I I hope that that's not true and I hope that we had issues with the product that we're deeper than that or something like that that caused it to not be effective in retaining users but at the end of the day we had a really tough time even given just a stream of crazy high quality content from the best people in the world on these topics it's tough to talk together as people with sticker okay so this is this is a tough question for any startup to answer which is at some point you decided it wasn't an issue of tweaks it wasn't an issue of being able to find product market fit that this you could you could pivot 10 degrees 20 degrees 180 degrees it wasn't going to happen and you wound the company down how did how did you guys come to that decision yes so we we did try a couple other related but more more than ten or twenty four twenty degree tweaks but related topics you know a subscription service we tried for a little bit and pitched some enterprise related things ultimately we decided that what we were looking at the possibilities we were looking at even if they succeeded couldn't be venture scale businesses that we need it to be betting on and it's these are conversations we had with our investors super honest transparent conversations with them with our team with each other and we said alright well you know the business our core business that we've envisioned and been working on for two three years don't think that one's gonna work at least you know with it without some crazy change and how people are thinking or us having some insane inside of fixing something that's terribly broken these other businesses were looking at other business lines there's a possibility but these aren't the type of returns that we're looking for our investors are looking for when we started this business and and so at that point we said all right instead of you know trying to keep this thing on life-support let's wind it down and move to our next thing and and keep building from there and it was a decision that everyone was incredibly supportive of again this goes right back to the good investor thing it is easy for people to give you a lot of grief when you make a decision like that but we were incredibly fortunate to have an amazing investors that supported us in that okay last question on side where do you think if you could have persuaded President Trump to call you fake news you might have been able to survive you know it's that we've talked about that a lot um I I don't think so I it's it's so bizarre and you know we could talk for hours about this but people would show up and engage and then they just kind of like disappear they'd be like this just doesn't it didn't doesn't do it for me and we talked to people and they'd say yeah oh it's great I like the contents really good I just I would never like you know go and read it on there like really pick it up in him you know there's not a lot of people out there that pick up the New York Times every day and read it cover-to-cover and that's effectively the same type of person that we were looking for someone that cared about that one you have to somehow make it a habit this is true for any startup you have to somehow create enough value so that you get integrated into people's lives and it's hard to do that with news and I do think like that you alluded to the like people want 140 or 280 characters of crazy stuff sure there's an element of that that is people want the crazy things that just spew up fake news this big news that whatever it is but the other piece of that is that it's easiest to create a habit with something that's bite-sized and what we were asking people to do was read a real conversation it was kind of like a I message format like people going back and forth and having these back-forth conversations it's not bite-sized takes you a few minutes to read if not longer to read these really engaging ones and there's smart people saying smart things you got to think about what they're saying and jumping from not engaging with a service to engage in with a long conversation you have to read it's a big jump to make and so I think yet to your point building habits is so crucial and habits are easiest started with something very small that might eventually expand to something big and think about how much time many people spend on Facebook but it often starts with something really small there to build that habit Facebook has great things around you know you sign up it's connect with ten friends they've got these like numbers if you need to do this you need to do that it's all easy it's all limited time and then the habit starts get ingrained and you can build it out bigger from there okay so let's let's transition to talk about and II Bromberg phase 2.5 where you went back a little bit to I would say a crypto roots but back to some of the some of the work you'd been doing earlier it's at Stanford and got involved with I guess nammal and an angel list and an eventually COI list how did that transpire yeah so even to take a step further back than that when I left school in 2014 I was crazy interested in crypto spending a ton of time on it with the the Stanford Bitcoin group my friends and people in the industry and the reason I didn't feel comfortable doing anything in crypto at that time was because of a secular issue for me which was at that point 2014 I couldn't make a decision if I was a coin flip whether or not there was gonna be one cryptocurrency forever Bitcoin was gonna be it and that was gonna be the end of it or if there were gonna be a ton of cryptocurrencies out there and I was looking at it and saying startups high failure rate already do I want to add a 50% coin flip to that because anything I could think of betting on relied on one of those two outcomes and I said I I don't want to add 50% more to an already high attrition rates I'm gonna not do this for now by the time it came back end of lather good news attrition rates so high that 50% hardly makes a difference double double your chance of failures is hard I want to take off and yeah and so I you know 2017 I'm looking at it and saying up I'm now a believer there's going to be at least more than one who knows how many successful crypto currencies in the long run we can talk more about what that number might be and how we should think about that but I feel comfortable going back to the space now and the story with coin list is that coin was started about a year ago just over a year ago we just celebrated our internal one-year anniversary and it was created as a collaboration between protocol labs proud Y Combinator company and an angel list to run protocol labs token sale for their product file coin for their token file corn and I think I think that you have to unpack that a little bit because I was trying to think about how hopefully a lot of the people here and out there have understand crypto currencies and there's lots and lots and lots and lots that's been written and said about them but maybe we can sort of very briefly outline what a cryptocurrency is what a token sale is what a token is and why you might be selling them yeah yeah everyone yes you know at its core yeah exactly at its core a token is a scarce digital asset we'll talk more about what each of these things mean a scarcity lasts that that represents ownership most commonly of a token network so the idea here is that when you launch a token network it goes out and no one then controls it so bitcoin is a lot of you know was created by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and if that's a he or she or a single person or a group of people no one knows who Satoshi is and somehow she's weird right like you make this this really important thing that's made and and lost fortunes for people and maybe will be the basis of the future economy no one knows where it came from weird right yeah like really let that settle it's worth like a hundred billion dollars right now the total market cap of Bitcoin and no one knows who made it and in fact Satoshi has some large number of tokens socked away in a wallet somewhere that has never been used we have billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin we have no idea who has that literally no idea if anyone has anyone right and so that is kind of the ultimate ideal how to think about it that that's possible you can launch this token network and have it go out into the world and have nobody control it and it just kind of happens and so what these companies are now doing when they launch these new tokens like protocol labs launching file coin their intention is to build a network got a lot of code to write they've got to build this thing and they're gonna put it out there into the world and they're of course going to continue to support it as you know core developers of the product and improve the network but they won't actually have control over at the users whoever those users may be in whatever categories they may fit into that specific network are the ones that have control of it well talk about what protocol Labs was doing because because the token is that protocol Labs is first token that coin list was working on was was not like you could say bitcoin is a value you know itself it's like a new currency but the token for protocol Labs was inextricably linked to a different value that was being delivered to consumers right yeah yeah we should talk about that one other thing I want to mention just on tokens in general and this analogy is a little bit of use but there's one reason I'd use it I would think of tokens and blockchain technology which powers many tokens like the internet for one really core reason if I asked you hey Jeff I've got a website and here's a bunch of data about it how do you value it it's impossible to answer that question because if that website is nytimes.com or amazon.com or google.com or facebook.com those are all totally different businesses they were all built on the Internet sure but you look at each of their revenues they've got different multiples how do you think about how these businesses are built saying how do you value a website is kind of a meaningless question you have to know much more about the specific use case and how it's built and in the same way I think there's a lot of discussion I get the question a ton from people okay but how do we value these tokens and to me that's a little bit of an impossible question because tokens are built on different premises and of different applications and you can break them down into categories that go to how to value each of those categories in the same way you could say well how do we value a social networking website or how do we value a news website or how do we value you know a CPG website but you have to think about those categories and the idea of a token or blockchain technology is really just this kind of meta concept it allows for other things to be built on top of it and and one more piece of that analogy would be yeah I draw a similarity between the Internet is infrastructure for exchanging and transacting information it moves information around tokens and token networks are infrastructure for transacting or exchanging value so for the first time we can actually kind of programmatically exchange value in this in this core way what are the strange things about the whole conversation so so here's how I would answer your your question about how to value a website and actually is the way people have always valued things which is well I would say huh let tell me about the cash flows that that website will generate over time and then historically we've figured out ways to value those things using things like net present value and all these these economic concepts but tokens seem somehow different because they don't necessarily seem to be tied to cash flows see yes let's talk about file coin like you were saying it just as an example and this is again just one example of many in one of many categories I'll give kind of a quick description of file coin and how it works we can go into it more in the QA so file coin is a token that allows for the exchange of file storage of files it's aiming to sort solve this problem of how do you store files and transact that until the market for storing files and so if you think about the simplest solution to how would one build a business to solve that problem the simplest solution probably looks something like Amazon s3 if Jeff has files that he wants to store and I'm say I'm gonna start a business that helps him store these files I'm probably gonna buy a bunch of servers and Jeff's gonna hand me files I'm gonna put them on the servers when he asked for them back I'm gonna hand them back and he's gonna pay me so that that works bigness today built like that but it has a few problems so one you've got someone that's taking fees I'm charging on top of the storage costs for him to be able to do this but there's also issues of things like censorship so I now have access to his files I can censor them I can look at them I can do whatever I want to them and you're relying on a single third party not to mess anything up so I could corrupt the files I might have downtime and not be able to return them and see you start say well is there a better solution than this and the first version of a better solution I think looks a lot like kind of the Airbnb of file storage where you'd say all right well instead there's a whole bunch of people out there who have extra storage space in their computers yeah raise your hand if you have extra storage space on your computer you're not seriously raise your hand come on all of you you all have extra space no your computers are full okay let's do it we're pivoting so you know I would say maybe all right well now Geoff Hammil your files I'm gonna find someone out here I'm connected to all of you I've got software on your computers I'm gonna put the files on your computer and then you know Jeff wants them back I'll ask in the back I'll take them I'll give them to him he'll pay me I'll pay you okay so these people the few people who raised their hand so we'll rent like Airbnb they'll rent a piece of their stores that are not using to the network so that so that's a good solution but it doesn't solve all the problems we talked about it does first of all make it a little bit cheaper most likely because this is kind of late and storage space is cheaper than buying new servers but still there's a middleman right there's an intermediary me who could go down I could have downtime I could sense where the file is gonna look at them so you're still trusting someone so file coin protocol Labs building file coin and the underlying thing called ipfs the interplanetary file system does the coolest name for a file system ever said is there a way to solve this can we connect Jeff directly to people out here who have extra storage space with no trusted intermediary that's the problem that by Allah coin is trying to solve they build this token for a few reasons one file coin is used as the mechanism of payment so Jeff pays you to store his files with file coin but there's a couple interesting problems we have to solve first of all what if one of you does something bad you corrupt his files you lose them you don't return them fast enough so there's first step of the solution is to make each of you that is storing his files for him already have file coin so if you have extra storage space you already have to a file coin and you do what's called staking you take those tokens and you put them up effectively in escrow and you say here I'm putting my own tokens up and putting something at stake and if I get caught doing something wrong if I don't return his files fast enough I don't you know return them at all then I lose my tokens so you are disincentivized from doing something bad to Jeff's files that's interesting step number one you're on to the second problem which is who's the judge of that if we're not trusting a central intermediary how do we know if you are not storing the files well or corrupting them or how do we know if you're not returning them fast enough and that's where it's step two of this really interesting solution comes into play which is that there's a massive network outside of this room thousands of people of what they call verifiers I'm gonna oversimplify what they do a little bit because they have this crazy thing called proof of space-time over the top you talk for hours about it but a simple solution for how to make sure that each of you is storing his files correctly is that a thousand different people come to Jeff and they each say to Jeff hey Jeff what's the 46th letter of your file what's the hundred and twenty seventh letter of your file what's one hundred and ninety-six letter of your file and Jeff says it says J a and K right and they go to each person that store in the files and ask that exact same question that person who asked about the 47th letter says hey what's the 47th letter of the file you're storing you answer that J and they check a K and now all of a sudden when enough verifiers do that we can say with confidence that the person storing the files for Jeff is doing so correctly and at that point the network says great job everyone Jeff pays you for storing his files you get your state two tokens back Jeff gets his files if he wants them and the verifiers get rewarded by the by effectively mining new tokens are minted by the network and given to the verifiers for doing that work which makes the supply of coins expand over time exactly and so then you have this market where each of these three parties the person with the files the person with the storage space in these verifiers are all incentivized to do the right thing disincentivize we're doing the wrong thing and there is no trusted intermediary and you avoid all those problems I sided with the S three example at the beginning and that that really gets to the core of what this all is and I'll I'll stop rambling in a second here but block chains and tokens are about incentive alignment it's about this question of how can you build a trust list system a system where no party has to trust any other party in a system without anyone being involved in managing that and the way to do that is to properly incentivize everyone and build these economic systems that allow for that interaction to happen and it I think that's one of the best articulations I've heard I've heard of what the blockchain based tokens are about incentive alignment but they're about one more thing isn't it true that they're also about removing aligning the incentives of the folks in the network so that you can remove the central authority so that you can remove Amazon in the s2 case or the United States government the Fed in the Bitcoin case right right and that's that's for any number of reasons and that goes back to could be for pricing reasons it could be at the middleman is charging fees that are unreasonable could be for censorship reasons in the domain of censoring it could be for fear of surveillance it could be for any number of reasons but ultimately the most common and effective use of these blockchain systems is to yes remove that middleman and make it this trustless system can exist just between the counterparties that need to be involved in a transaction kind of the ultimate ultimately Democratic version of networking right markets for everything yeah so so everyone out here in start-up school world might be asking themselves cool crypto cool tokens what does that have to do with me what what does this have to do with startups and and you know we um you know I've talked a bit about the history of investing in we've come to this place where where tokens are in fact an important component of of how startups raise money and and exist maybe you can talk a little bit about this this evolution to where I SEOs initial coin offerings and the role coin list is playing yeah so so it probably a little bit of an unusual perspective here right yeah coin list we run token sales we make money when people work with us to run their token sales that's great I think today token sales are a good idea for an incredibly incredibly incredibly small number of companies I think of the twenty-seven thousand is that right companies in start-up school there may be a few where it's a really good idea for a token to exist not all 27 thousand today there are cases I can make four in the future and making sense for a broader set but today I think it's a very small number just give you a data point on that coin lists we've existed for about a year we've publicly worked with five token sales in the last year we have had inbound people asking us to work with them more than 2,500 token sales and that's not a it's not a bandwidth issue that's not you know it's not being able to service that that's us sitting there and saying yeah these 2495 tokens not a good fit for us and that that's kind of it that's like like like the one of the largest euphemisms not a good fit for you meaning maybe not quite legit maybe so so there's certainly a large set we see of scams and spam and frauds and people that are you know bad actors or just how much how much just to riff on that for one second how much has been raised on icos and 2018 thus far yeah very it's a tough industry to study but probably somewhere around 15 billion dollars it's a big number more than venture capital just just to repeat that in case someone maybe didn't hear that clearly more money has been raised in ICO than has been delivered in venture capital to companies in 2018 thus far yeah and and some people look at that and say wow what a great sign for the ICO industry we are thriving I look at that and say that seems really concerning to me because venture capital has been around for as we've talked about before almost a century of like real kind of true development and venture capital especially for technology companies pretty well developed industry we figured out kind of the norms and how these things need to be created the idea that ICS have really only existed for four years and really in kind of their mass for about two years the idea that we could surpass that so quickly in that stage of development I see is actually a more concerning thing than a positive thing for the ICO industry one thing it shows is demand because these are proxies for investing in startups but it also I guess shows a propensity for people to believe things that maybe they shouldn't be believing yeah I think that's right now you know it's also just a function about being a new industry that its brand new it's really hard to diligence for these investors there aren't norms there's no data points right now on what tokens are successful and which ones aren't we're so early into the industry and that's it's not because everything's failed it's because it's just too early to know and so investors don't have a good sense for how to do diligence I think about you know understanding what they represent right because at least if you're buying a penny stock you still know that that penny stock represents a claim on the future cash flows or that company in one way or another admittedly that is a theoretical thing but at least it's grounded in something concrete a lot of times these I SEOs aren't rounded in anything but I also I don't think it has to necessarily be quantitative I think about the YC process for admitting companies and all the data you guys have on years of startups and what succeeds and what does and what are positive signals and what are and how you look through those applications that you just can't do that in tokens right now there's no training data to look at and so that's resulted in this kind of we've got to be over the aggressive mentality from investors of let's get in let's get in these things gonna make us rich that's I think pumped up the amount of money that has gone into the space past where it really reasonably should be and it may be that that's an important step in the cut in the industry's development do you need this kind of huge infusion of capital to give the winners enough money to start to win and then you can sort out how do diligence it better going forward but certainly the vast majority of that money that has gone into icos is going into I SEOs that are not going to be successful so just for for the edification of everyone here could you just step back and say what is what's an ICO so what are these token things what does coin list like why would you use coin list I can't you just do it and and and then maybe we can transition to like to answer the question you sort of talk about ladies who should think about doing an icy on who shouldn't yeah so and just on terminology for folks that are kind of newer to this space I tend to use tokens coins cryptocurrencies all synonymously crypto assets even some people have slightly different definitions I tend to use them all the same and then I see oh token sale kind of the same thing in my eyes so those are generally synonymous an ICO or a token sale is ico initial coin offering is when a new network is being created and a company is issuing tokens for the first time in this network concerned to distribute them and they've run this token sale to do two things generally one to raise money for the future development of that network and support that network in the long term and two to get early distribution of those tokens because these networks like vile coin only works if there are people who have it to store files people who have it to you know give files to be stored and and kind of incentive alignment around that so you need a way to distribute these tokens initially one way to do so is to sell them and so they they go out and conduct these sales where they go and sell tokens to investors or to users that want to eventually participate on the net right and that's a case where the the network literally does not work unless you have a token yeah that's exactly right and so while chrome is the first token sale that we supported a coin list they raised a staggering two hundred and five million dollars in their initial coin offering and we've worked a number of other ones since block stack and props in origin trust token and what coinless does is for that small set of companies we support the logistics of the token sale so there's a bunch of compliance work you need to do which is probably not worth getting into but you'll hear these buzzwords know your customer kyc anti money laundering you need lawyers to be involved and and we have many of them and and so we you know handle the compliance we had all the transactions have payments work and money comes in we handled you have to know how this is gonna work with the SEC cuz they're they're going to be already are intimately involved right lots of open regulatory questions lots of closed regulatory questions you need to know how to be able to answer correctly and we support these companies that process and then we'll you know market some of these deals publicly or offer them to the investors on our platform to be able to invest in we also have four other services like that just compliance piece without the marketing as much we do for a broader set of token issuers this whole other airdrops product to give tokens away to users um so you'll start hearing this buzzword airdrops more and more I think this is a way of giving so we talked about icos being a way to fundraise and to distribute tokens to users sometimes you might not need to do the fundraising part and you might just want to distribute tokens to a wide set of users how do you do that giveaway and the the first example of an airdrop I would argue one of the first was was PayPal when they got started and he signed up for PayPal you get ten bucks of PayPal credits wasn't a token obviously but they were saying we've got a network we need people to use this network we just need to give them a little bit of money to get started they can send some money you send it to a friend pay for something and then they're gonna get really addicted and start to put more money in and that's what an airdrop is it's a way of saying and it worked it worked yeah you can give tokens away to people they can start to use on the network and then hopefully they become such a fan of that network that they put more of their own capital in to use it so who amongst start-up school world should think about tokens as though as a way to kick-start their network to raise funds potentially and who shouldn't yeah so so today and this is again where I differentiate premier today and and you know tomorrow or the future today I think the most valuable applications of this technology are applications where you have parties are not willing to trust each other they're not willing to trust each other they don't want to trust a central intermediary either and you to build this trust --less system this does not describe a lot of businesses but where Trust is is somehow fundamental to the functioning of whatever product you're creating exactly so if we look at an example that I would say is is a not a great candidate for a token there's possibilities but not a great candidate would be Airbnb so on it on its face you would say this actually sounds pretty good I want to stay somewhere someone out there I've never met before has a home that I can stay in I don't trust that person I've never met them before I've got no connection to them but I do trust Airbnb so you can have this intermediary I've no problem trusting Airbnb I stay in them all the time and I say alright if the Airbnb is vetted them and they're backing me up they've got their insurance thing we've got all this no problem I trust Airbnb let's do it that means not a great candidate for a token but if you start to have systems where you don't trust even the intermediary much less the person the other side that's where a token might be a good fit and the reason I'm not giving a Russian version of Airbnb maybe maybe you'd want a coin for the totally possible or in it yeah absolutely and Trust in institutions is is fading there's all sorts of research on this Edelman puts out a great survey on trust every year and and and so there is an idea that this could be more of a thing in the future but the reason I'm not answering your question with just a slew of examples I can give you of like if your business fits this do if your business fits this to a token if your business is because I just do not think there are that many today and so it's it's more about finding these very specific use cases where it's particularly valuable to have a token than to try and fit into a category that could have a ton of tokens coming out of it I want to say some time for questions but but just before we move on you've talked in the past about pros and cons of of tokens versus say convertibles of various kinds like YC safe that that probably most startups used to raise money now both from the the perspective of a start-up company and from an investor maybe could could we talk a little bit about those yeah so you know everyone in here you're in this class has done a lot of thinking about traditional financing and things like where you will if you have it yes absolutely keep an eye out for those lectures things like investor protections what rights do investors get how do you have to deal with them how do you fundraise for them you sit down and talk to them you follow up you do a call there's all these things that go into a traditional funder things we think about with tokens a lot of that is flipped on its head so probably the biggest difference is that when you buy into a token and this goes back to our original discussion of what a token is the company does not control the network in this ideal form they release this network and it goes out to the wild and you own tokens on that network you own part of that network but that means you have no formal relationship to the company as an investor in these tokens and as a company technically you have no formal relation to the investor that owns your tokens and so there's this idea right now in startups of you know we talk good and bad investors like they may call you they may check in you've got an obligation to update them you've got an obligation to get them to sign documents at certain times and transactions happen when people buy into a token network released by a company none of those obligations go and there are pros and cons to that certainly on both sides of the equation on the startup side you know on one hand way easier these people don't have any stake in your business you can do whatever you want with the company itself there's no control that they have there the downside of that is they are not necessarily aligned with you so the upside of equity is that it's upside when someone wins with equity everyone wins with equity in the in the general case obviously there's some some edge cases but incentives are aligned and that's that's awesome with tokens the incentives of the investors are not necessarily aligned with that of the company so if the token is pumping up for some reason of flying up the charts an investor who invested a ton of money doesn't have any lock ups on it they may just say yeah I'm getting out I'm up 10x right now that seems totally worth it I'm getting out and they dump it and it hurts the price and it hurts the company by kind of second-order effect there and so you get this kind of misalignment you win because they don't have any stake in your company but you lose because they don't have any stake in your company and from the investor perspective the exact flipside of that which is on one hand you're not obligated to the company at all you can do whatever you want you just own tokens on a network they've released but the other side of that is that you might not get as much visibility into what's happening get those monthly updates you might not be as engaged with the foundries you may have never met the founders the idæan startup fundraising of raising of people that you've never met before does not really happen that much occasionally you see a little bit with certain things but and you usually advise against it usually advise against it in token world you know many of these sales have had hundreds or thousands of investors that just signed up on the website you know coinless facilitates this people come and invest in sales where they have never met talked to you can go to coin lists right now and sign up for token sales you certainly can you can only participate if you're an accredited investor unfortunately site regulation sadly but but yes you may have no relationship to the founders again pros and cons on on both sides there yeah it's kind of amazing from an investor perspective because if you invest in a startup company usually before you see any return it's a lot of time five ten years but with a token if the token goes up tomorrow you can you can invest and sell the next day right now do you think we are converging tokens again our young repeat this myself all the time there is such a young industry they are converging a little bit more towards venture capital we're starting to see vesting schedules and lockups for investors trying to get this incentive alignment a little bit tighter than kind of the freest version that I was just describing and I think a lot of its gonna converge that way you know early in the ico market companies raised once they said we're gonna raise one monster token sale that's gonna be it will never need to fundraise again more and more we're seeing people talk about kind of stage things that start to look a lot more like a traditional seed Series A Series B and so it's gonna look more like venture capital future I think but there's still going to be these key differences of what it is that you're buying and what that means for the relationships between the people involved awesome so in the time remaining if there's any questions on any of the topics we've talked about okay right here in front room [Music] I have two questions one about venture investors you said good investors if you could share with us like three big points okay okay hang out there we'll get we'll take each one and turn so what are um what are the characteristics of good investors in your view yeah so talk about a couple characteristics and a way to find out the characteristics that I think are really important for investors is one alignment with whatever your goals are as an entrepreneur not everyone's goals in this room are going to be exactly the same some people might be saying for me this is a ten billion dollar business or bust that is it that is all I'm going for and I will always make the decision that leads towards that outcome others might say listen if I built a ten million dollar a year revenue business I would be super happy and I'm looking for investors for that if investors are not aligned with that goal you're going to be in big trouble because you will eventually make a decision that runs exactly counter to what they want and so you need to make sure they're aligned with you on that second how you interface with them is the interaction friendly it can be intense they may do diligence and maybe some real back-and-forth and firing back and forth but do you walk away feeling good after your interaction with them if you do not that is not a good sign because you are talking to them at a time when it's supposed to be really positive you're talking about joining forces a one plus one equals three situation if you're walking away and saying this does not feel totally right that's a really bad science at some point in all likelihood hate to break it to you things will not go perfectly I'm not saying the business gonna shut down or anything but you will have a tough time at some point and if an investor is not great when things are good or you're talking about possible ways to work together and build something amazing they will be really bad when things are going poorly and so I'd watch out for those those are kind of my two biggest things the last one is people argue about this all the time but the idea of value add I don't think every investor has to be some sort of crazy perfect they're gonna make some amazing difference in your business but if they're aligned and you need capital and they believe it's a good investment that can be fine you don't necessarily need someone that's going to do everything but when you can find those investors obviously that can make that introduction for you give you that customer feedback whatever it may be recruit someone that's tremendously valuable the the last thing I would say on that is that super underrated part of fundraising is due diligence and reference checks on investors so few people do this but it is amazing you talk to an investor you're getting towards it you're saying Jeff I think we've got a great relationship here I'm really excited about working with you I think we could do something amazing and I would I would love to work with you as one of my investors um is it cool can I talk to some people that you've invested in before I just want to go since you're working style and kind of like how we could work together in the future now first of all they say no to that really bad signal right anytime someone says no to reference check bad signal they'll probably say yes and talk people that he sends you maybe talk a couple other people that you know he's invested in that he didn't send you and just ask them those questions because every founder that's head an investor can give you a very intuitive gut check on Jeff's amazing he was actually their darkest days like things were tough he came into the office helped us figure out product stretch this happened that happened and then you go back to him and you say to him you have I'm even more excited now because I talked a bunch these people and they said you were so helpful on this you were so helpful on that I let's make this happen that's the most exciting way to close an investor conversation highest chance close to the money and you've now set expectations or on what you hope the relationship will be like and so I definitely do those calls it takes time but it's worth it for investor that you're looking at work so that was a that was a solid gold answer so please please please pay attention pay Andy's wisdom there yes okay so the question is given the nuclear winter of in crypto land is coinless looking to pivot to stos or are you going to stick firmly with icos yes so to unpack that a little bit sto is a security token offering and this goes back to what we're talking about before around the blockchain and token infrastructure being something that you can build a lot of different things on one of those things that people talk about is what's commonly called a security token or an asset-backed token and this is an idea of taking an existing asset something that exists in the real world the traditional world maybe startup equity real estate maybe gold bars whatever it may be and building a token that represents that asset so one token equals you know one percent of this building or this buildings revenue streams whatever it is and and the question is you know we looking to support those where traditionally we supported i COS of these tokens that are more kind of token networks that only exist in the network itself and not in the actual I guess you could do an IC o---- of an STL it's really it's like it's a little totally so that's right where I'd go on that is that um we are certainly looking to support offerings of security tokens we don't see that as a pivot we actually see ourselves as just infrastructure to support sales of tokens thus far they've happened to be what are commonly called protocol tokens where these kind of Network tokens and they function on these on these networks alone if the tokens were offering our asset-backed instead of network backed that makes no difference to us as the platform we just have to figure out if it's a good fit for our investor base and if you know that can happen but ultimately the process for running those sales is exactly the same awesome yeah our tokens currency regulatory answer totally depends practical answer yes and no in the kind of colloquial form of currency where you're using something to exchange for something else absolutely most of these tokens are some sort of object fits into that category some might not be so one example often refer to bitcoins value as a store of value and that means some really think of Bitcoin most analogous to digital gold gold is not a currency you can use it to exchange for things but it's not really great for that it's more used to store value put value into it you take value out of it and that's how I see the value of Bitcoin I don't think it's the same for every token more of these tokens fall into that an exchange category but from a regulatory standpoint of colloquial definition the answer largely is no to that but in certain cases maybe yes again depending on the exact characteristic so we could talk about specific examples and bitcoins complicated because there's Bitcoin cash which is maybe a currency totally different token so Bitcoin cash but it's a totally different currency although yeah okay maybe maybe that's too much yes [Music] if everybody did so if Airbnb started today would they be a good candidate for an ICO I don't think necessarily I again I go back to I trust Airbnb I have no problem with that and yes I'll go forward and rent someone's house through Airbnb and be happy with that there are arguments that it could be successful in that manner because maybe it's less fees if there's less of a middleman but Airbnb does provide valuable services to me as the consumer and I'm willing to pay for those services I don't feel like Airbnb is taking unreasonable fees on those transactions because they provide a lot of services and so you know do they need a network I don't think they need one could it be an interesting service could be a potentially competitive service absolutely but I if I were starting that business today I wanted to connect you know homeowners or apartment owners to people that wanted to stay there I would probably go the centralized route initially but with an eye on the crypto space and seeing if there might be opportunities in the future the last thing I would say on that is it is underrated today how hard it is to build these token networks it is so hard they're so young the tooling is not there development is incredibly challenging augur was really the first ICO that officially launched in a big way three years from there ICO to launching they just launched this summer and the amount of work that went to that is unimaginable I mean you have to replace the human beings at air and be Airbnb who are building the processes and infrastructure to make it a trusted no precedent for how to build these things and so you know even that alone you're looking at it as a business trying to you know raise as little money as possible and push forward of what you have it's a tough move but do you think it's fair to say that there's a faction of crypto world that says central authority bad and we should replace all of those with a network a trusted Network absolutely and I think a lot of crypto has its roots in this kind of a narco libertarian philosophy that I think was incredibly important for the early days of crypto because that is one of its core use cases this avoidance of middlemen and driving the industry forward with that philosophy is incredibly important but that's very different from looking at it from a a really pragmatic from this side and there may be some crossover there but it's not 100% right over there [Music] one question at a time because it's really fun to pile them on but there's a lot of people who want to ask questions so ask them that's the one you really want answered first how do you distinguish between value and information yes it's a really important question I think at its core you can represent value in information right so I can make online transactions with the internet without tokens and move value around but what that's really doing is moving symbolic representations of value around and directing different entities to move it so when I make a payment with my credit card on the Internet sure it is just information that is moving I'm sending authorization codes my CVV goes here and this happens but ultimately what happens is it goes to one issuing it the credit card issuing entity and conveys them the information and II just spent $10 on this merchant please debit $10 or you know put $10 on a nice balance and then merchants please here are $10 you have now been paid for your services what didn't happen there the internet did not actually transmit that value those entities on either side push the value from one to the other they may have done it over the bridge of the internet but they were the ones that were maintaining the value what's interesting with this token ecosystem is that the value is actually totally contained in the network there are no entities that are actually holding that value for you there's no credit card issuer that is keeping an eye on my balance and taking payments for me and there's no bank on the other side that is holding on to the the merchants money instead all the values representing the network and people actually own that value so I have my own keys on that network I own those tokens or I own the representation of those tokens I'm not just owning information that gives me access to someone else owning that value so at the end of the day going just a single player example my bank account it's my money but it's not really my money the bank has the money and I just have information that allows me to access that money in the world of tokens I actually have ownership of that that is those are my tokens because I have the keys to access that and no one else can do anything with it aside from me who has that access and so when we talk about transmitting value as opposed to transmitting information it's about direct interactions between nodes I can pay Jeff with tokens and it never touches a third party at all where's with information it requires those third parties where you're informing them to move money between each other yes so this is I guess more of a comment on the rigidity of networks once you put them out there it's hard to then go and change them and upgrade them and make them backward compatible to other things do you agree with that yes and no I think again early days so there hasn't been a lot built around the upgrade ability of these networks and once you put them out there it's harder to make those changes especially breaking changes there's more and more infrastructure being built that supports that it's something that I'm not incredibly concerned about in the future it's something that feels inevitable that will get to a place where these networks can be easily upgraded at the same time goes back to this idea no company controls that Network and so they can't dictatorial II make that change if they make a change and the users on the network don't agree with it the network will do what's called forking we could talk for hours about this where you get to difference and this is where the Bitcoin Bitcoin cash piece came in you know Facebook makes a change I can't just like make a new Facebook that goes back to the old change that doesn't work I don't have access to all of Facebook's infrastructure and code in the crypto world if you know say Protocol Labs me to change the file coin that people didn't like it would be totally possible for people to start back right before that change happened with the entire history of transactions with all the code and make a new version of Pyla coin by coin cache and it's out of file it's out of protocol ABS wholly controls yep so as you vote again goes back to this incentive alignment thing that sure maybe someone has can write to this version of the protocol and make changes to it but they have to make sure that all the users are aligned from an incentive perspective to participate on that same network going forward instead of forking it or not because you can fork and then that fork is then backwards-compatible and the new one isn't it or vice versa and so maybe it's easier because of the ability to fork absolutely yeah more questions over there is it possible for the someone who's a node a person who's part of the network to propose a change that then gets incorporated into the network yeah absolutely so any one node or otherwise can try to fork a network and create a new version of it with a with a change there's again no special control that these companies have over these networks other than some sort of moral authority right if they created the network I probably trust them to be kind of the best stewards of that network and know how to build it they're probably the biggest experts onyx they built in the first place so you're gonna probably go with their version until there's a reason not to and as soon as there's a reason not to which could either be because they do something bad or because because someone else proposes something better they could be going on a great path and making a great product but if someone else in other node anyone in this room says I've got an improvement to Bitcoin I think it's to be better than what the existing core developers are doing I'm gonna propose that I'm going to align people around it and get people's attention around it that could for can be more successful and it's totally up to that person to do so let me argue that for a sec please isn't it true that to really let these these these decisions become somewhat democratic and so the network decides but isn't it also true that these companies that that do i SEOs and and are the creator of a token tend to hold a significant portion of the currency for themselves and therefore have the biggest voice on the network yeah so a couple things one is when I'm answering these kind of high-level questions about crypto I'm thinking purely of the good the very small set of good tokens there are lots of bad actors out there that build in all sorts of weird ways to influence the network but just talk about the kind of ideal of these tokens and blockchain networks that's where we're going on these on these questions absolutely some of these issuers have significant stakes in the network but a couple things happen to one the voices are not always based on who is the biggest stake in the network you know a really important voice is whoever is is mining and this is a whole nother topic for what the consensus mechanism is so on Bitcoin the Bitcoin core developers there's a group of people that have kind of access and can try and change the code of Bitcoin but it has to be adopted by all the miners which of these people running huge server farms doing work on the Bitcoin network if those people choose not to adopt it even if they've you can think of a Bitcoin core developers as being from the entity that created Bitcoin which isn't really true in that case again created by a pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto but you know the the the miners have the power they're not the people that are kind of core developing it and so it depends on again how the how the network makes it so it's complicated it is complicated okay a couple more questions right there yeah so what what develops would I expect to see in the ico industry before they become a viable path for more startups it really depends on and again this goes back to it's a really good question what we mean by so when we say ICO we're talking about Mitchell coin offering when we say coin or token what are we talking about and that's where it's it's so many different things so what we've really been talking about here is a history of successful or you know looking to be successful protocol tokhes these tokens that are network based that have have this trust avoidance our trustless networks I don't think there's a world where every startup is going to need to do that I'm you know I trust my corner store to give me good food I trust my guru you know so that that will always exist and so I don't ever think that every company will need to do a token of that blend but you can imagine a world go back to the SEO question where there are tokens that represent company equity and I am purchasing company equity via a token instead of some other document than equity round or safe or whatever it may be and maybe it's it there's an underlying safe below it and there's a token that represents it for that to happen I think what we'll need to see is just a lot more infrastructure we built out there's reasons that that is a good idea to have these asset backed tokens things like increased access to liquidity there's all these exchanges being built and liquidity pools for increased liquidity for these asset backed tokens they're interoperable with each other so you can move them around more easily I think was the trend Jeff and I've talked about before generally the arc of venture capital bends towards increased liquidity and speed to liquidity and these things come faster and faster a little bit of a speed bump in recent years but generally I think moving that way and tokens will only continue that trend so I do think as infrastructure gets built out it may make sense for companies to raise equity with tokens that represent that equity and that is not some sort of crazy ico phenomenon will you be able to go out as a seed stage startup and say you know my token is worth 200 million dollars no it's it's gonna represent the equity and it'll be worth what the equities worth maybe with some premium for the benefits of tokenization on top of it but we need infrastructure there and until that infrastructure exists I don't think it's worthwhile except as maybe a proof of concept for people to show that it's possible but we need more built there and hopefully that gets built in the coming months or years great one more question right here yeah do I think the futures gonna be a handful of block chains are hundreds of block chains and you know I think it'll be a relatively small number of block chains but a relatively high number of tokens and to explain that for just a minute here many of these token networks allow for other tokens to be issued on top of it most common buzzword you'll hear aetherium which is the second biggest cryptocurrency out there it's got a blockchain the ethereum blockchain and they've created standards on top for theorem to issue other tokens on top of ethereum and the one you'll hear a tossed around a lot is in ERC 20 token this is a token that is issued on top of the etherium blockchain but represents something other than aetherium and its price is not necessarily correlated with that of aetherium I don't think there's a need for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of block chains to exist because they are a pain to maintain you need to all these users on it you know with different mechanisms for how they interact with each other but I do think we're gonna have a world with a lot of different tokens maybe not as many as some people think I'm not kind of a tokens for everything but if we get to this world of asset-backed tokens where all of a sudden buildings could have tokens to represent their ownership or companies kind of tokens represent their ownership that's a lot of tokens that are possible out there but they will they will not all have their own block chains that would likely be built on something which will be very error-prone if they do right because because it's all new code and there's a brace for it to be safe and secure and so maybe they'll all be on ethereum or stellar or one of these other networks but lots of tokens relatively few block chains would be my prognostication the last point I would make on that is once again we are less than a decade into crypto at all we are less than five years into tokens beyond you know the very basic building blocks at all that is the earliest earliest days imaginable of this ecosystem and any prediction that makes day stands probably a worse chance of being true than than a good one so who knows we'll see you the next day in the coming decades that's great wait and thank you very much for your time and thank you thank you guys [Applause] you
