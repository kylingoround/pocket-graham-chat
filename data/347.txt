the average person probably doesn't know what segment is mm-hmm so could you explain for sure so segment helps companies give their customers a better customer experience and we do that by helping them organize all of their internal data about all their interactions with the customer so for example if you go to the bank they interact with you at the ATM at the teller via a phone call center they have a web web app a mobile app they send you emails they're interacting with you across this huge surface area and they need to be able to coordinate that interaction right they need to know that if you encountered an error on the ATM the teller needs to be able to say like I'm so sorry you encountered an error about to be able to help you and so what we do is we help sort of bridge that gap of having a single record of all those interactions with each customer mm-hmm because previously companies would build all this in-house or not at all maybe yeah there's there's sort of two worlds one is they would build it all in-house exactly I'm gonna be a rat's nest of data pipelines from one place to another and so the engineering team would spend all their time building these data pipelines rather than actually building things for the customer that's one world the other world is one where it really used to be a one-on-one relationship with a bank branch manager for example and they might keep the information in a CRM mmhmm right but if you are similar would be an optometrist right you go in they have your past orders etc but now the world is moving much more to a Warby Parker kind of world where you're not interacting with a person so a CRM doesn't even make sense it's like not the right technology for understanding what interactions are having with a customer and instead it's all these different digital channels so that's where we come in and your first customers were they large scale companies like banks or who did you get in the beginning at the very beginning we actually launched as an open source library on Hacker News yeah and it took off there blew up basically overnight so to be fair it was kind of like the long road that's not a year and a half of dark times yeah yeah we shouldn't we shouldn't totally go over that but okay yeah so anyway you you blew up overnight again once it once it went live on a Chen it blew up overnight and so our first customers were the folks hanging out on on hacker news it was basically small companies for the most part founders who were looking for better ways to insta their web applications and mobile apps mm-hmm with this sort of analytics tracking and so the initial growth was that was just completely unpaid customers right so they're just using the open source whatever you put up on github right so the strange thing about the open source library which is sort of this data router so you put in one piece of data customer did X and then we turn around transform it and fan it out tall it from places downstream and what's funny about the library is if you want to turn on a new tool if you want to send the data to a new place you need to recompile the library and redeploy it to your website so it doesn't actually the open source library doesn't quite actually solve the problem which is really a market or a product manager wants to use a new tool so what happens is you really want to use the hosted version yeah so almost no one actually uses the open-source version as was addressed by design no no this is completely accidental really yeah there's just no way to make a good open-source product around it yeah that's crazy so okay so what did you apply to icy with we actually applied as a classroom lecture tool so the idea was to give students this button to push to say I'm confused and the professor would get this graph over time of how confused the students were we thought it was a really cool idea we were college students at the time and we had a bunch of professors who were excited about it at MIT and elsewhere I'll never forget our in our YC interview we were pitching this and PG was getting pretty excited and then he turns to professor Miller from from MIT who we had talked to and had given us the original idea for it and says hey would you use this and professor Miller says no probably not we just rolled with the punches and said yeah well you know we talked like twenty other professors and and they were all excited about it oh man but then you went through YC with this all right yeah building it out right we went through the whole whole YC with this idea built it out hundreds of thousands lines of code super complicated class or electrical product to have like presentation view and people could ask questions it's very complicated we were actually even raised money at demo day with this idea about 600k finally we deployed it in the classroom as the fall semester got started after demo day it was just a total disaster all students are my laptops and then I went straight to Facebook so the way we discovered this is we were standing in the back of the classroom counting laptop screens it'd be looking over the shoulders of the students near one two three and yeah we discovered at the beginning of class about 60% of students were on Facebook and by the end about 80 percent were on Facebook oh me in other words they were supposed to be using your desktop app the whole time that's right in the professor at the beginning class had been like can everyone please get out their laptops we're going to use this mute and all of a sudden all these students are distracted by Facebook so we had accidentally sort of put in an attention attention bomb if you want yeah and you hadn't brought on any users during why so you were in the suit wait I wrote it you were in the summer 2011 bat that's right summer 2011 and you weren't testing during the batch we tried testing but there's not that many classrooms that are in session during the summer right the school year starts in September so we had beta tested in a few summer computer science classes at both Stanford and Berkeley yeah but there was always technical difficulties and other things that sort of prevented us from getting like a real sense of what was happening often times it's pretty Yolo I don't I just we didn't really get tests rolling until right until the fall okay and so what was the like the come to Jesus moment where you realize you had to change the product standing in the back of a BU classroom as an anthropology class and I remember arriving at the 60% and the 80% and we went up and apologized to the professor and and at that point you're just like okay we got to kind of shut this down or figure out what to do with the money yes right well we had we had just gotten wires for these for these checks for this money like literally a week before right so we called back all the investors and we were like well it turns out this is a terrible idea so what do you want us to do with the money and almost all of them said well you know we invest it for the team so so go find something else okay um okay next day next day we're like well what are we gonna do and we realized we should have been able to figure out some of this analysis by not just standing in the back of the classroom like we should've been able to see some of this digital you couldn't see it in the analytics metrics at all so we decided hey let's build an analytics tool let's build a better web analytics mobile web app analytics tool to compete with Mixpanel and Google Analytics the idea was to give really advanced segmentation because we also wanted to understand how some computer science classrooms at MIT we're using it differently than anthropology classes would be and we couldn't do that analysis and the tools we had so that was the idea was to build an analytic tool mm-hmm we spent about a year building the infrastructure necessary to do the analytics and really we're not succeeding in getting any customers during that timeframe so you had I mean did you have a whole onboarding process was it like a landing page what did it look like oh yeah we had a landing page I was going on little sales trips I was meeting with people tell you so you were trying oh yeah we were trying okay but it was it was not going well basically what happened is people would say well I already have this other analytics tool installed so like it's not that interested you definitely you have the time you were not 10x better than Google no no yeah yeah were you at parity we were at parity in certain dimensions and we were exceeded in other dimensions but they just weren't them dimensions that mattered apparently right okay so you're just kind of like blow up overnight with accra news and that like this is well so positive we're not even this is just the analytics tool which we realized in December 2012 was failed so we're like well over a year into the analytics tool we're now have tried two ideas both have failed neither is clearly gonna work at all yeah we realized that we're screwing up so we decide to have office hours with YC again I would come back walk around a little cul-de-sac by YC with with PG he started comes ta stop and says so just to be clear you've spent half a million dollars and you've nothing to show for it gulping moment yeah I guess that's true and it was a good sort of come-to-jesus moment though and you got a pause there and then rewind all the way back to the first week of YC and it was in that first week that we'd been like well we should have analytics tools on our classroom extra tool say we've googled analytics and we found Google Analytics Mixpanel and KISSmetrics and we're looking at them we're like we don't know which one of these things we should use all right like they're kind of all similar but Google Analytics is a little more marketing a KISSmetrics is a little more revenue we mix panels a little more product II in terms of the sorts of insights they can give you and at the end of the day that they all collect the same data they all collect basically who is the customer and what are they doing mm-hmm so we decided to write this little tiny abstraction that could data to all three I was like 50 lines of code among the hundreds of thousands for this classroom lecture tool and then we decided we'll just send it at all three we'll look at all the tools and we'll just pick the one that we need so it'll give us a lot of option allottee basically for free yep and then we forgot about it for like four months so months later we clean it up a little bit more four months later it cleans up a little bit more as I mentioned now we're struggling at that point we're struggling with this question of why I already have mixed panel installed so I don't really want to use your analytics tool yeah so my co-founder Ilya has this idea he's like remember that little library wrote that sort of abstracted away the differences between these tools and what a Sun data to all three what if we added ourselves just the fourth service that I could send data to you and then every time someone has that objection we hit him back with an open source library that they can use to send to us and them that cause seems like a clever growth hack it like gets us around this problem so we did that cleaned it up open sourced it and people started replying like all this libraries great we'd love to use it couple weeks later we'd follow up and be like hey well we saw you're using you know the open source library but all you have to do is copy paste our API key so that you can use our analytics tool could you just copy paste the API key yeah no like yeah so we started just feeling like there's some traction on on this little routing library which is maybe up to like 25 stars on github or something like that like not not much but some people are issuing pull requests and it's the first time we've ever faults are like pull like it if you always we weren't just pushing a boulder uphill this is a little different but subtle we had this conversation with Paul Graham the next day we sit down this is our second time with this we're like okay we have 100k left in the bank what's our final shot and my co-founder Ian is like you know what I think there's a big business behind analytics j/s which is this routing library like that is literally the worst idea I've ever heard like it's 500 lines of code to grow a little bit's 500 lines of code in it's already open source I have no idea how you build a business around that yeah and so we fought about it all day long I was four of us I was the most skeptical I think just literally like brutal brutal fighting I went home and I was trying to figure out how to kill the idea was awake half the night finally figured it out came in the next day I was like alright guys here's we're gonna do we're gonna build like a beautiful landing page really gonna pitch the value of this analytics j/s open-source library and it'll have a form at the bottom so that we can get people to sort of express interest put it up on Hacker News and we'll see what happens I was thinking like totally kill it right I think that's well in hacker news right yeah so we'd build a landing page put it up on Hacker News and this is where we have this you know you're in half in the making overnight explosion yeah and that that kind of segues into your whole startup school talk right about legs right basically real product market fit yeah and up to that point in your life had you launched anything where the market I mean this is a Marc Andreessen quote because he kind of coined the term it pulls it out of you right that's right I think you experiencing hmm I think that's an apt description I had never experienced it before and it feels very much like losing control right like previously you're like building a thing and you roll it out in a building a thing you're pushing it out and all of a sudden you like put a thing out there and people start running away with it and using it in ways that you didn't necessarily expect and you're sort of like what it's just an it's just a man like stop stop it like we need to fix these other things because otherwise it's like this feeling of losing control and almost like the market is dictating to you now what the rules of the road are and what needs to get built interest so would you're a different feeling yeah would you differentiate that from overwhelming demand for one particular feature versus like we're just gonna take this and use it however we want but there's a ton of demand there would you separate those two things not really I think the people always want more features yeah but the the thing that flipped was people would previously tell us they wanted a feature but not use it whereas now people were using it and they would want a second feature and the it's a super important distinction I think a lot of founders get caught in this sort of I call the the death spiral of user feedback yeah where they keep going and showing someone their product and asking them for feedback they give them you know some feedback about how they could make it better but they don't use it and then they bring it back with those fixes and they ask if this is better and it's just like the death spiral where it never gets anywhere but once someone starts using it they'll have more requests and that just means they're gonna pay you more over time right yeah I like how you put it in the lecture where you basically if you have to ask yourself it's not product market fit yeah it's it's you really can't miss it you and said this was now six years ago five five or six almost almost six years ago yeah right and half you and you're so feeling the same way yeah yeah and since then we've had a few more sore a secondary product market fit moments like what about two years in we discovered that all of our most valuable customers were sending their data to an s3 bucket there's basically they're keeping log files of the raw data which was a little weird because typically what people were using the data for was to send to an analytics tool an email marketing tool and a CRM and help desk like places where a business person is deriving value log files is a little different that's a little weird it's unclear what the use case is so we went on this sales trip to New York myself and our first sales person RAF we met with five customers that were using this s3 bucket let me just ask them oh my god what are you doing with the s3 bucket the first customer was like well you know we have a data engineering team that's taking the data out of the bucket and converting it into CSV files and then they're uploading it to our data warehouse which is a redshift cluster so basically they were using it as the initial endpoint input into a ETL pipeline like oh that's interesting but man to the next meeting second customer is like well we have a data engineering team who's taking the data out of s3 converting it miss yes okay drops and that's interesting and then the third fourth and fifth ones all said exactly the same thing and and that was the point at which I started becoming a conspiracy theorist yeah it seemed it seemed like some pre meeting had happened now but they were all doing exactly same thing so it was really obvious we just built a way to load data directly from segments into a regio fluster huh and that was a huge thing like you you was really go out that it was product market fit again yeah it was very explosive so we you know we'd grown revenue from zero to two and a half million in the first year and then we launched this red shift connector and the next year one from two and a half to ten but people weren't asking for that that's right it was one step too far for them to realize that we could do it easily yeah their mentality I think was that oh segment is a way that I integrate marketing tools and so a data warehouse is in a marketing tool it's a bi tool surely segments can integrate that just didn't click ahead to go by asking hmmm interesting and and your growth how how how does that happen is it has it come through developers I go to market model is primarily through through engineers yeah we talk a lot about sort of the way that we've built our infrastructure over Jim we obviously process a lot of data so there's a lot of interesting infrastructure problems I think now we're processing you know hundreds of thousands of user actions per second so there's a lot of data going through there we write about that that's generally interesting to that to the hacker news and an engineering crowd and yeah typically an engineer is the one that brings this brings us in sometimes that really technical product manager but it's someone who's like yeah this is gonna solve this weird rat's nest data pipeline problem that I've got well and how much of it is open source still a good portion of it is is open source but most of the value that we deliver is actually by running the hosted version right cuz it's like at the end of the day it's not just the develop like you're you're saving the developers time but it's these business people that really need it yeah and and frankly most of the complexity is hidden away and how you actually operate and scale a data pipeline that that is processing the data yeah so you know our JavaScript libraries open source our iOS SDK is open source or Android SDKs open source II wouldn't sort of collected data from anywhere and those collection libraries are our open source but the sort of core infrastructure pipeline is not hmm okay and so right before you guys launched on HN where did this like small tiny micro launch I whatever it might be were there other avenues that you were considering pursuing like in that debate in the day before mmm were you thinking about other stuff I think the debate was whether to build out the full product and then test for product market fit by trying to sell it to people versus this super super lightweightt MVP landing page that we wouldn't put on Hacker News to see if there was interest in the concept yeah and and what drove us towards the super super lightweightt test was actually the fact that there was a skeptical divide among the founders and since the founders couldn't agree the only way to answer the question was to go to customers a SAP and get an answer okay it's tough like the the launching early thing is always a because I think there have been instances where people are like I will just launch this early but because they're like 10% off of what that product ought to be or they're not very good at communicating it they never really get the feedback that they need right like how do you how do you kind of balance that out like this is kind of like fully formed enough or were communicating it clearly enough that we can launch it like how do you determine that usually that test is so cheap to run that it's worth running even if you decide that it was inconclusive and you should go a step deeper mm-hmm but I also think that the way frame fit is actually an excuse that a lot of founders use for not doing the cheap early tests when in fact they they should yeah I I get the the same questions like almost every single podcast and I should be a little bit of a devil's advocate here but yeah these are kind of like straw man arguments right I think the really big product market for moments for every company are pretty unmistakable like the Dropbox founders have called a stepping on a landmine I just I really don't think you can mistake it it really happens in a way that you you lose control it's very obvious every much metric goes haywire people are talking about it a lot it's not it's not mistakable or like oh well you know this person said that it looked valuable and was really exciting and blah blah blah if they're not using it like it's not there yeah okay well okay so there's a question from Twitter it's clear that a bunch of people have watched your your lecture so this first one from Aaron Evan Farrell he asked you mentioned in the startup school lecture that you had to pivot to analytics j/s to find Prada market is it possible to purely iterate on something like that to find product market fit or should be clear from the outset if a new idea is something people want there's two versions of this I will say the Airbnb version of product market fit is much more iterative they struggled for years and years and made slight iterations and iteration that iterations and finally I caught on and obviously they're they're their runaway success my feeling is that that's extremely rare and that again this is a really dangerous place to be because you can stay in this iterative mode for years yeah and it is unlikely that the iterations are going to get you to a good place so I remember very clearly early on being really inspired by the Airbnb story and it being a logical reason why we should keep plugging away at a bad idea and I think we abused the Airbnb story to just keep stringing ourselves along on a bad idea so I would be very very careful of following their B&B example I don't know many other companies that that hit proud of market fit that way right and so how long do you give an idea at this point I actually don't think that it's quite the right frame to think about it in terms of how long to give an idea okay I think what you want is someone either yourself or someone else on the founding team who's a skeptic so someone who is going to have enough context with whatever the specific idea is and whatever the sort of regime or market you're in someone who's skeptical who will question and push for the fastest reasonable test so in other words if you have an optimist and a skeptic and they both agree on what a valid test is then I think you actually lend up with a good test but if you have three optimists in a room who all agree on what a good test is I don't believe that that's a good test did over skeptics but yeah do you have you recruited skeptics or did you just kind of like luck into that I think we lucked into it the first time yeah I do think we have some folks on the team that segment some early folks who are who are skeptics usually about future product market fit moments that we've had and I think it's been enormously helpful that's really interesting what how do you test for that like in an interview scenario we didn't test for we just got lucky again but yeah okay so not even just with co-founders like with early employees as well that's right yeah how interesting like how hurtful can it be if someone is like well I really think you haven't thought this through there's like these three things that you should really test ASAP because I don't really believe that you have product market fit here right that's what you want you want someone who's gonna be like pushing it and you're like what happen yeah how would we and then who's willing to collaborate with you on how you should reasonably test whether those things are the case so the sorts of tests that we have run for example with this mindset recently and even in the past year yeah where should we switch from a technical buyer to a marketing buyer unclear how to test that well so the this early skeptic who's amazing her name is Diana she I was like well I'm just gonna go to a conference with marketers and I would try pitching a bunch of marketers just flew to Florida and pitched a bunch of marketers came back she's like nope not a good idea and I read my own set of tests so like the the hacky ways to test these things I think are very valuable in it and it it comes from having skeptics who and different perspectives of people willing to go test those things okay and so I imagine these these tests from skeptics occur on a maybe daily but probably like at least a monthly basis right in terms of you guys working on your product yeah I'd say maybe more on like a pre idea basis so like if we're gonna launch a new product then it's really helpful to have a skeptical perspective of like here's why this might not actually be a good idea and do you rely more heavily on data or actual customer interaction like in the early part of the product development process it's all qualitative it's all talking with customers okay because this is the thing that bugs me more is like when people are just like putting up landing pages left and right and like thinking that they can like kind of uh I forget what it's I will call it like what do they do it doesn't know yet like Imagineer your way towards them like winding down this path to finding it in an advanced inefficient with time yeah they're scared yeah and and when you actually go and talk to a customer if you have that conversation in the right way you'll learn a thousand times more from that conversation than you will from them from putting up a landing page yeah and I think ultimately we learned a lot more from talking to our customers after the hacker news landing page than we did from the landing page itself yeah totally so what are your what are your tactics when you're talking to customers yeah I'd say the main thing is most founders are not familiar with how a sales process is actually run and you basically want to run a sales process so the the sort of typical founder motion with running a sales process is the they come in and they say okay I'm going to give you a demo and it's like really shiny polished pitch and then the customer decides at the end of that pitch whether they're interested or not that's not actually how good sales works at all the way good sales works is you do qualification up front so you have some method of understanding the customers problem better than they understand it themselves and then you do the computation in your head as to whether your product is a fit for their problem there's a lot of methodologies for this the methodology that we use that segment is one called medic ME ddic it's literally just a list of sales qualification criteria and this is this is what sales reps do if a sales rep comes back and we're like we're gonna close you know this this this deal the sales manager says okay well let's go through and metrics what are the metrics by which this company is going to judge whether or not the product works for them and if the sales rep can't answer metrics economic by our decision-maker decision process the identified pain and doesn't have a champion if they can't have all six of those things yeah there's no deal and so when you're searching for product market fit you can just go through all of those things by asking the customer a ton of questions mm-hmm and then you can grade whether or not you're actually going to build a product that will solve the problem right well this is it kind of ties into this like skeptic versus like optimist idea right you have someone who's like a champion of the product and in many ways I mean maybe this is you like the optimist who just sees the world and they see this future and it looks awesome it's amazing but you need that skeptic who sees the world as it really is that's right and a sales qualification criteria is is a way of almost putting the skeptic out as they like structured process that enforces some level of skepticism yeah I think it's so dangerous when you're the author because I fall into this camp for the most part like when you get good at sales you can kind of sell many people on almost anything but if that product doesn't exist yet it's very easy to just kind of mold it in the way when you're reading someone you're like oh I can totally kind of want it to be like this so I'm gonna kind of go down this path but then when you actually show them the product and they're like like you said they won't even install it then you see the world that's it really is yep and that's the thing and so we you guys are just like going out and how are you still having these conversations with people personally sometimes yeah for sure yeah yeah because this is one of the things that like people I think in large part because they're influenced by your startup school talk they have so many questions about it and so Benjamin Liam asked like you know how do you even how do you find that you have the right messaging around you're explaining your product oh man this is super hard I'm not even the right person to ask about this I should Diana who I mentioned before in our VP marketing Holly are the two people who have really refined our messaging over the years and we're always trying to refine it so I don't know how you know that you have the right messaging you know that whatever messaging you can sort of test whether alternate messaging is going to work and you can do that yeah qualitatively in interviews with customers you can try explaining it one way and see if their eyes light up you can try explaining another way and just sort of see what what resonates I think a really talented early salesperson will also have this sort of pattern in their in their habit of how they pitch that they'll always be testing different ways of explaining the product that was definitely true for for the first salesperson that we hired he was fabulous it just like constantly experimenting with different ways of doing it so I don't know if you there's you never know if you have the best messaging but you are constantly searching and testing for four different ways of explaining it okay but but again like if it if it's about you know really finding a good product market fit yep do you think that leave these like minor changes and how you communicate something will will make the difference I don't think I don't think minor changes then it will make the difference now once you have product market fit then sure you can optimize the messaging okay so then we should talk about idea generation because that seems more important yeah and these like minor deviations yep weird where do you begin yeah I think the best ideas that we've had come so there's a big difference between the first idea and these sort of like follow-on ideas and and the reason so the first idea meaning like the core product that's and then the individual features that's right okay and not just individual features you might have entirely new products that come along but those are much easier right the the problem with the first product and product market fit is that you can move the product and you can move the market because it's fit between these two things and so it's unclear and they move in some crazy multi-dimensional space and so what's the the issue is that to get them to both match up you can always move either one and in different conversations in one conversation you might shift the product and you might in a different conversation realize you need to shift the market so that's super tricky I don't think there's a repeatable way to do that mmm I think you just have to go very very deep into a particular market and understand the problems that people have in that market so do you have a particular a process for idea generation or you just you get into something and you're like man just go super deep yeah for that first idea you just have to go super deep you just have to understand the market and the ecosystem and the customers upside down backwards better than they do themselves okay so you were booted from segment today do you know where you would start you'd have to start with something that was interesting to you personally and then you'd go dig in in a deep direction I think that it becomes more repeatable when you are finding a second product so at that point you've mostly lost the market side right because you already have a buyer you already have a go to market motion you already have like an area of interest which for us you know is these sort of data pipelines and data infrastructure customer data infrastructure then it's much easier because you know exactly who you need to go to and you know roughly the like type of questions that you need to ask and then you can run a process which is much a much deeper x-ray of the customer than you might be comfortable with at least it was much deeper than then I was comfortable with when I first got started like as an example we recently were testing product market fit for our product we're gonna announce at our user conference in September and that's now in beta and it's doing really well but the initial way that we were sort of testing fit there we would go in and say like oh hey do you have you know a problem with with data cleanliness and the person would be like oh yeah yeah totally that's one of our big problems yeah I get cool cool like okay - that is and we might ask like two or three more questions but like that was sort of the depth but the actual level of question needs to be like okay well like what do you mean Didache like how do you do you currently invest in data cleanliness at all no like oh well yeah we actually you know we have a team of like six people who do data QA con all the time like oh well those data QA people like where are they based or they're based in LA Oh interesting so they have like real salaries and their knobs overseas they're like real like us salaries like yeah yeah okay so what like 80k a year 100k yeah yeah yeah that's about right so like okay so you're spending you know like 750 K a year for this data QA team and like tell me more about that process like what are they queueing exactly oh well they're clicking this button in the app and they're like well which button yeah and then are they like in the OP where they do when they find a bug and so we would ask like literally 45 minutes of questions like this and now we actually understand their problem and we understand what they're doing we understand where their cost centers are we understand how this thing and then we're like oh well what if we did a product that did X yeah which is exactly what they just explained to us for the previous 45 minutes and they're like that would be amazing they're like okay now wait now this is that was both sales qualification and discovery yeah which is a standard sales process but now it's being used for product development and that's such a good learning because people aren't gonna tell you no way I think a lot of people just get scared to like ask these questions totally the customers will tell you yeah especially if you if you take the champion part of medic their last one the C and you just start by asking like what's your vision for X thing that you do John will tell you you're like oh we our mission is similar because that's why you got the meeting in the first place that person is instantly aligned with you they'll talk for 45 minutes about their problems before you have to tell them anything yeah I think that's one of the things that most people don't realize it like many of the best salespeople don't talk that much the best salespeople at segment ask why to the point of uncomfortableness from everyone else on the team including myself yeah interesting yeah I wonder what the correlation is between sales and skepticism it's probably pretty high and people who are questioning things and I can see the angle yep hmm all right next Twitter question so Danny Pro first of all he says go Peter and his question is about a culture so he says what values and standards do you have in place for your team at segments and how do you actively build that culture into your company yes we have four values that segment that we're quite dedicated to the first is karma which is we want to have a positive impact on the world and that manifests itself in a bunch of ways one of those ways is we really care about the customer having sort of getting value out of our entire process so you'll notice that all of our marketing materials for example are often like highly educational we have a really high bar for what an education piece of educational material looks like even in the sales process we want to be helpful if we're not the right fit will tell you and sort of like refer you to the right places separately we really care about doing the right thing by the end-user this is still within karma and that's from like a data privacy perspective so we're very interested in helping companies understand all of their own first-party data so all their interactions with their own customers within their four walls we're super uninterested in helping companies data broker data between different companies schedule a we call it data gossip it's gross we don't want anything to do with it there are plenty of other companies out there that that have stuff like that it's gonna go away and die eventually so that's Karma we care a lot about that the second one is tribe which is a segment we're all there to support each other we're all there to accomplish the same thing and so what we expect is that and what we value is that people really support each other both when they may be struggling with something but also giving them giving them crit so really try to reward folks who are who are willing to go the extra mile to give create when it may be hard could be giving crit across teams or up several levels or whatever that's that's really something that we value hmm the third is Drive much more self apparent we like to get done we value people who are getting done and the fourth is focus which is not just sort of the ability to sit down and get stuff done but more power through something but actually thinking carefully about prioritization we've done a lot of research around how to make the office environment you can actually focus so check out our blog we've we've written about sort of sound decibel levels that we've measured around the office and how we've mitigated that did pretty well that piece did pretty well read yeah and and it was a surprising result for us to discover the different parts of the office had very different sound levels that were not correlated with people talking but were just correlated with the sort of acoustic shape of the of the office and so just moving people around into different places helped a lot depending on how much noise they were willing to tolerate and sort of need it in their role hmm so anyway those are those four values we they are literally the things we value and so we pushed into all the places where you would expect what you value to have an impact so it's who gets highlighted at all hands we have a citrus prize which is someone who's living all the values promotions hiring we have a strict interview in the hiring process we have performance we need a strict interview sorry we have a culture interview where we have these four values and waste specific ways that we're going to test for them when we run performance reviews the performance of you is literally the four values are usually like these this is what we value and therefore it's what we test and measure by and I think ultimately it's that cycle of giving feedback and measuring by it that is what drives huh culture to stick and it has this been something that like came natural to you like building culture or did you have to learn it I don't think so I think we I think we learned it mmm we got to about 25 people before we realized that it was something that we should write down and we went off site four founders went off site and we tried to synthesize the values out of what it was that we really liked yeah there was Apple Reddy happening and what it was that we didn't like that we had a scene already happening and not just among the team but amongst ourselves to like what were we not proud of that we had done and what were we proud of that we had and that that ultimately was what got synthesized into those four values hmm and so those were just interactions with other people or like literally product building no interactions with other people and and interactions with partners and customers and things that we were proud of mm-hmm that we wanted to see more of right on so next question Ashwin doke asks how is GDP are impacted segments business model so GDP are for those who don't know is a new EU regulation which basically gives end-users a lot of rights about the data that's collected about them and first off I think it's an awesome regulation both as a consumer but also wearing my segment hat it's interesting in that it impacts the entire globe because if you are storing data about in use it isn't it doesn't matter what Roche diction you run your company in you were still responsible to do that for an EU citizen the biggest impact broadly on the overall ecosystem is it really negatively impacts third-party data and third-party data brokers because they have no real consent path to the user for sharing and buying and selling the data because we help companies purely with their first party data it's not like a existential threat to us in any way and in fact it's something that we're really sort of aligned with for another reason as well which is because we're routing the data out to all the different places where people are using it so we're routing it out to an analytics tool to an email marketing tool to a data warehouse to a CRM to a help desk to ad conversion pixels if that user shows up and says hey I want you to delete me from your system well it's actually like 20 systems for most companies and we're already plugged into those 20 systems so it's actually now a feature of segments that we can go to those 20 systems and delete whatever user is requesting it and clean up that record across all those different systems so for us GDP r1 is like aligned with our values philosophically - is actually an exciting new feature sort of requirement that we can support and a sort of value that we can provide to our customers so we're huge fans nice that was a unsuspecting sir but uh people have been stressed out about it my friend makes Instapaper and they have a big issue with it's a big problem in publishing where they relying on third-party damn yeah especially these like little tiny products that are parts of really big companies even they didn't necessarily know and yeah another everywhere cool all right so next question and roopa cool asks any advice that you have on asking for more money than you're comfortable asking for this is part of your startup school lecture well I guess one of your sales reps was forcing you to ask for more a lot more yeah yeah we had a sales advisor who is well I gotta back a little bit we were initially selling our product for ten dollars a month and you know hundred twenty dollars a year and we brought on the sales advisor and his first advice was well you have to ask for $120,000 a year and I was like that's a thousand acts that's crazy so we were going to the first sales meeting me and him and is with a company called xamarin and I've since told NAT this story which he found amusing but now was the CEO of xamarin and as we're walking up our sales advisor says okay you have to ask for a hundred and twenty K yeah him this meeting and I was like that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard I'm not doing it and he's like well if you don't do it then I quit as your sales advising alright I guess I'm asking 420 K so we go in we have to you know demo and everything yeah and he says okay well what's the price and it's 820 K and I turned beet red and he says well how about 12 K a year I said okay well how about 18 and he's like okay fine so from his perspective 85% off from my perspective I got 150 X and it was a successful negotiation I I think I think it's really hard to offend people with price at least if you're sitting in the same room or or on the phone it's probably not a good idea to share pricing information via email if you do that then it's really easy for them to hang up but if you're on a phone call or in person there's a bit of a social contract to a continue engaging particularly in person you can recover so I would encourage you to not be scared of offending someone with a high price yeah but maybe just start in person which is probably the most uncomfortable place to do it but gives you the most opportunity to recover right and the thing is like if it actually banished your business then that's just what it costs yeah you're gonna have well and you have no other way of assessing the value yeah yeah and then in fact what will happen is when they say that's crazy then you say why and then they'll explain to you how they actually value the product and then you say okay and you value it according to their logic and you ask for that price and how long did it take you well are you charging them 120 now for sure yeah we have customers to get way more value than that out of it now yeah exactly and so how many customers did it take you to reach that six-figure amount a dozen at most yeah so it was amazing yeah yeah cool one carlos garza asks how did YC help to get segment where it is right now YC was super helpful the most impactful thing early on is just demo day you're not going to find a bigger concentration of investors who are excited about investing in startups creates a compelling event structures the timeline in crowd way helpful for a first round of financing that can easily get strung out and waste a lot of your time yeah that's the first thing the second thing really is the is the founder network there's not only a lot of reasonably high profile companies now that you can learn from or companies that are sort of farther ahead that you can learn from now but there's companies at all stages so there's almost always a group of people in your area or in your market that you can learn from and share from so all the there are tons of little groups that spring up you know like a group of enterprise founders that are all between like 70 and 100 people in San Francisco and you can have dinner once every two months yeah and that becomes an incredible support group and sort of way of learning about about what's going on have you stayed in touch with people from your batch a few yeah exact same some good go right on yeah I've heard of like these informal founder meetups happening quite a lot and again yeah it seems to be great and uh it's a trusted network there's no replacement for that yeah totally I definitely didn't get that from college all right Juan has another question in the early stage what's the thin line between ignoring a customer's suggested feature or moving a customer's requested feature to the core of your application or product I think what I think what he is trying to ask is basically like at what point do you say like hey this customer is requiring or asking for this feature and we have to kind of hold the line because we don't want to become a custom dev shop so should we integrate this or tell them to you know find someone else the best defense against that is having a clear product vision for where your product is going to go long term and if you have a clear product vision for where it's going long term it's a very simple question of yeah is this thing in that picture long-term or not and if it isn't that picture long-term then you can prioritize it to be sooner or later depending on whether a customer is going to pay for it or not yeah and if it's not then it's not and you probably shouldn't build it right yeah I think that's like that the infamous customers you don't want in Scenario yeah where you just have to let them go yes I I guess the important thing is like imagine the entire timeline of everything you're ever gonna build feel free to move things around we do this all the time we move things around based on like what customers actually want has it's a reasonable signal of what's actually more important yeah but I wouldn't I wouldn't add major things or remove major things from it just based on one customer mm-hmm so since you've done YC and it's been several years now would have been the biggest learnings since oh my gosh so many a huge bucket or a huge area of learning for me as weird as finance like I mean I came from an aerospace engineering background and then we were doing software engineering for the first couple of years and so you just start completely unprepared for preferred the like business side of of things so I've learned a tremendous amount about about finance as we've raised money and and and you know learned to manage your business with a piano and all those things not that you should rush into it but it's it's a huge area that can be leveraged I think and you would have if you were to do it again hired someone earlier on who knew what they were doing in on the finance side I actually think we did a reasonably good job of that so we hired a part-time CFO around town that raised our series a so we were about at about a million in revenue and we were raised to fifteen million dollars here he's a we had had a bookkeeper up until that point but we were like I feel like we should have someone like you know point us as to what we should be doing with the money and maybe have like a plan or a model or something so that was definitely the right time to hire a part-time CFO and Jeff berkland was super impactful over the years intro would have been the other big important hires for you that I made like a huge difference I'll have remembered the exact hammer a whole bunch of people but advisors maybe is an interesting category sure part time CFO I think is in that bucket we had an HR advisor who was really impactful we've invested more in HR than most startups yeah of our size and I think that was the right thing a lot of startups like uber for example do not and end up with I think really high prices for this way I think it's a challenge right because if you if you go around and start googling like should I hire CMO should I hire CFO should I hire XYZ I think you can always find someone strongly advocating for any particular role but the challenge is like okay you know you only have so much and so much time and you can only find so many great people so like where do you and where and when do you decide to hire those like optimal people for this stage in your company right and so yeah just kind of curious if there are any big turning point moments for you it was a huge turning point around 10 million in revenue when we hired the first team sort of execs to the team yeah one is our VP of engineering and the other was a VP of people they were the first people who had previously been managers and our VP of engineering had managed a team of 150 at Dropbox so we went from literally zero management experience aside from what had been picked up along the way going from zero to 50 people to having someone who really knew it or two people who really knew what they were doing that was hugely impactful and we should have figured out a way to do that earlier 50 people in 10 million revenue or whatever it was was way too late yeah cool if you weren't working on a segment right now do you have an idea of what you would oh man I get to occasionally invest in YC companies nice and there's a lot of cool things happening there I was blown away by this like breadth of things that are happening in the batch this batch there was a really exciting company building in space rocket engine and another that was doing industrial inspections by drone I just can't imagine a world where we continued have people in harnesses hanging off of wind turbines that's I can't imagine that that continues for a long time so that seems like an obvious market opportunity so flying things I have a background in aerospace engineering cool man so if people want to learn more about segments where should they go if they want to learn more about you yeah segments just go to segment com or you can tweet at me on twitter i'm ryan pique rei NPK okay cool yeah we'll link it all up all right thanks man cool thank you you
